The Big Short
Synopsis:
Three separate but parallel stories of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005 are told. Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the f

    Hi ya Frank, how are the wife and kids?

    You know, shouldn't y'all be considering

    treasury bonds or utility stocks?

    In the late seventies

    banking wasn't a job you went into

    to make large sums of money.

    It was a fucking snooze!

    Filled with losers!

    Like selling insurance,

    or accounting

    and if banking was boring...

    Then the bond department at the bank

    was straight up comatose.

    We all know about bonds...

    You give em to your snot nosed kid

    when he turns fifteen

    maybe when he's thirty

    he makes a hundred bucks.

    Boring!

    That is until Lewis rainieri

    came on the scene at Salomon brothers

    you might not know who he is

    but he changed your life more than Michael

    Jordan, the I-pod and YouTube put together!

    Hey gentlemen, let's get

    some money in here.

    Let's make some money!

    What do you say?!

    You see, Lewis didn't know it yet,

    but he already changed banking forever

    with one simple idea.

    The mortgage backed security.

    Or... private label mbs

    you got your average persons mortgage

    fixed rate, thirty years, boring!

    Same, small payoff. Right!

    But

    When you add thousands of them

    all bundled together

    suddenly, the yield goes up, but the

    risk is still small, because...

    Well, they're mortgages, and who the

    hell doesn't pay their mortgage?

    What exactly is the

    credit-rating on this bond?

    This bond gentlemen...

    Is AAA-rating!

    This is exactly what the Michigan state

    pension fund has been looking for!

    I'll buy twenty million!

    Oh come on, live a little!

    Twenty five million!

    The money came raining down!

    And for the first time, the banker went

    from the country-club to the strip-club.

    Pretty soon, stocks and savings

    were almost inconsequential.

    They were doing fifty, a hundred,

    two hundred billion in mortgage bonds

    and dozens of other securities a year.

    And America barely noticed that it's number

    one industry became boring old banking

    and then one day,

    almost thirty years later, in 2008

    it all came crashing down!

    Bear sterns was in a death spiral

    and the fed brokered it's sale.

    In the end Lewis Rainier's

    mortgage backed security mutated

    into a monstrosity that collapsed

    the whole world economy

    and none of the experts, or leaders,

    or talking heads had a clue it was coming.

    And I'm guessing most of you

    still don't really know what happened.

    Yeah, you got to have somebody to repeat

    so you don't sound dumb, but come on

    Our financial institutions are strong!

    But there were some who saw it coming.

    While the whole world was

    having a big old party, few

    outsiders and weirdos saw

    what no-one else could.

    Not me, I'm not a weirdo,

    I'm pretty fucking

    cool, but we'll

    meet again later!

    These outsiders saw the giant lie

    at the heart of the economy

    and they saw it by doing something the

    rest of the suckers never thought to do.

    They looked

    through the nineteen thirties

    The housing market collapsed...

    Nationwide.

    By approximately 8 percent.

    And halve of all .. Eh... worries that...

    It wasn't default.

    There were.. Very...

    Specific identifiers.

    Extremely recognizable.

    Wait... for instance

    w-w-w-w one of the hallmarks of mania.

    Is that rapid rise and complexity,

    and the rates... they are fraud-ed

    did you know...

    They're going up!

    I've always been.. More comfortable..

    When alone.

    I believe... maybe... it's because of...

    My glass eye.

    I lost the eye...

    In a childhood illness.

    Separates me from people.

    Did you know... they're going up!

    Highest frog-rates since

    the nineteen thirties.

    No, I didn't know that.

    I mean.. Ghe Ghe Ghe...

    Nine... nineteen thirty three

    the fourth year of the great depression

Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
Is this real life? Or just fantasy?
EXT. SPAVE
A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.

				There is unrest in the Galactic Senate
				Several hundred solar systems under
				the leadership of the rebel leader, Count
				Dooku, have decalred their intentions to
				secede from the Republic.

				This separatist movement has made it
				difficult for the limited number of
				Jedi Kights to maintain peace and
				order in the galaxy.

				Senator Amidala, the former Queen of
				Naboo, is returning to Coruscant
				to vote on the critical issue
				of creating an army to assist the
				overwhelmed Jedi.

PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.

A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.

One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.

The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.

The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.

Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

				PADMÉ 
			Cordé...

She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordé's eyes are open. She looks up at her.

				CORDÉ
			... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... 

CORDÉ dies. PADMÉ hugs her.

				AMIDALA
			No!... No!... No!...

PADMÉ lowers CORDÉ to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.

				AMIDALA
			I should not have come back.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			M'Lady, you are still in danger.

Amidala says nothing.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			This vote is very important. You did
			your duty and Cordé did hers. Now
			come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
			please!

She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.

EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY 
The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! We shall have order! The motion
			for the Republic to commission an army
			takes precedent, and that is what we
			will vote on at this time.

Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.

				PALPATINE
			...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
			me... I have just received some
			tragic and disturbing news. Senator
			Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
			been assassinated!

There is a shock silence in the vast arena.

				PALPATINE
				(continued)
			This grievous blow is especially
			personal to me. Before I became
			Chancellor, I served Amidala when
			she was Queen. She was a great
			leader who fought for justice, not
			only in this honourable assembly,
			but also on her home planet. She
			was so loved she could have been
			elected queen for life. She
			believed in public service, and
			she fervently believed in
			democracy. Her death is a great
			loss to us all. We will all mourn
			her as a relentless champion of
			freedom... and as a dear friend.

There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			How many more Senators will die
			before this civil strife ends! We
			must confront these rebels now,
			and they need an army to do it.

A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the 
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.

				AMBASSADOR DARSANA
			Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
			this assassination? We are no
			longer safe, under their protection.

Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.

				ORN FREE TAA
			The Republic needs more security
			now! Before it comes to war.

				PALPATINE
			Must I remind the Senator from
			Malastare that negotiations are
			continuing with the separatists.
			Peace is our objective here... not
			war.

The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.

				AMIDALA
			My noble colleagues, I concur with
			the Supreme Chancellor. At all
			costs, we do not want war!

The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and 
applause.

				PALPATINE
			It is with great surprise and
			joy the chair recognises the
			Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.

				PADMÉ
			Less than an hour ago, an
			assassination attempt was made
			against my life. One of my
			bodyguards and six  others were
			ruthlessly and senselessly
			murdered. I was the target but,
			more importantly, I believe this
			security measure before you, was
			the target. I have led the
			opposition to build an army... but
			there is someone in this body who
			will stop at nothing to assure it's
			passage...

Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.

				PADMÉ
			 	(continuing)
			I warn you, if you vote to create
			this army, war will follow. I
			have experienced the misery of war 
			first-hand; I do not wish to do it
			again.

There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.

				PADMÉ
			Wake up, Senators... you must wake
			up! If you offer the separatists
			violence, they can only show us
			violence in return! Many will
			lose their lives. All will lose
			their freedom. This decision
			could very well destroy the very
			foundation of our great Republic.
			I pray you do not let fear push
			you into a disastrous decision.
			Vote down this security measure,
			which is nothing less than a
			declaration of war! Does anyone
			here want that? I cannot believe
			they do.

There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.

				ORN FREE TAA
			My motion to defer the vote must
			be dealt with first. That is the
			rule of law.

AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.

				PALPATINE
			Due to the lateness of the hour
			and the seriousness of this
			motion, we will take up these
			matters tomorrow. Until then, the
			Senate stands adjourned.

EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY 
The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.

INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.

				PALPATINE
			I don't know how much longer I can
			hold off the vote, my friends.
			More and more star systems are
			joining the separatists.

				MACE WINDU
			If they do break away -

				PALPATINE
			No! I will not let that happen!

				MACE WINDU
			But if they do, you must realise
			there aren't enough Jedi to
			protect the Republic. We are
			keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

				PALPATINE
			Master Yoda, do you think it will
			really come to war?

YODA closes his eyes.

				YODA
			Worse than war, I fear... Much
			worse. 

				PALPATINE
			What?

				MACE WINDU
			What do you sense, Master?

				YODA
			Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
			clouds everything. But this I am
			sure of -
				(opens his eyes)
			Do their duty the Jedi will.

A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.

				DAR WAC
			The loyalist committee has arrived,
			my Lord. 

				PALPATINE
			Send them in.

They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.

				YODA
			With you the force is strong...
			young Senator. To see you alive
			brings warm feeling to my heart.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
			have any idea who was behind
			the attack?

				MACE WINDU
			Our intelligence points to
			disgruntled spice miners, on
			the moons of Naboo.

				PADMÉ
			I don't wish to disagree but I
			think that Count Dooku was behind
			it.

There is a stir of surprise.

				MACE WINDU
			You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
			was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
			assassinate anyone, it is not in
			his character.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			He is a political idealist, not
			a murderer.

				YODA
			In dark times nothing is what it
			appears to be, but the fact remains
			Senator, in grave danger you are.

PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.

				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku has always avoided
			any kind of conflict. It appears
			he has no desire to start a war.
			Why would he kill you? To what end?

				PADMÉ 
			I don't know, but everything in my
			being tells me he was behind it... 

After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to 
Mace.

				PALPATINE
			Master Jedi, may I suggest that
			the Senator be placed under the
			protection of your graces.

				BAIL ORGANA
			Do you think that is a wise use
			of manpower during these stressful
			times?

				PADMÉ
			Chancellor, if I may comment, I
			do not believe the...

				PALPATINE
			..."situation is that serious."
			No, but I do, Senator.

				PADMÉ
			Chancellor, please! I don't want
			any more guards!

				PALPATINE
			I realise all too well that
			additional security might be
			disruptive for you, but perhaps
			someone you are familiar with... an
			old friend like... Master Kenobi...

PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.

				MACE WINDU
			That's possible. He has just
			returned from a Border dispute on
			Ansion.

				PALPATINE
			You must remember him, M'Lady...
			he watched over you during the
			blockade conflict.

				PADMÉ
			This is not necessary, Chancellor.

				PALPATINE
			Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
			will rest easier. We had a big
			scare today. The thought of
			losing you is unbearable.

AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.

				MACE WINDU
			I will have Obi-Wan report to you
			immediately, M'Lady.

YODA leans into her ear.

				YODA
			Too little about yourself you
			worry, Senator, and too much about
			politics. Be mindful of your
			danger, Padmé. Accept our help.

As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.

				PALPATINE
			I will not like this Republiv, that
			has stood for over a thousand
			years, be split in two

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT
A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand.

				JAR JAR
			Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
			to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!

OBI-WAN smiles.

				OBI-WAN
			It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.

				JAR JAR
			Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
			Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
			completely forgot myself for
			a moment there. I have had to learn
			Diplodiaclect... speak it like a
			native now. Don't really see the
			point, actually, but members of
			the Senate seem to prefer it...

JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			...and this, I take it, is your
			apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie?
			Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
				(Looks at Anakin)
			Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!
			Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no
			believen.

				ANAKIN
			Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.

				JAR JAR
			Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING
PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI.

				JAR JAR
			Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
			dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
			myself again.

PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.

				OBI-WAN
			It's a great pleasure to see you again,
			M'Lady.

				PADMÉ
			It has been far too long Master
			Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
			have crossed again... but I must
			warn you that I think your
			presence here is unnecessary.

				OBI-WAN
			I'm sure the Jedi Council have
			their reasons.

She moves in front of ANAKIN

				PADMÉ
			Annie??
				(stares)
			My goodness you've grown.

They look at each other for a long moment.

				ANAKIN
				(trying to be smooth)
			So have you... grown more
			beautiful, I mean... and much
			shorter... for a Senator, I mean.

OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.

				PADMÉ
			Oh Annie, you'll always be that
			little boy I knew on Tatooine.

This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.

				OBI-WAN
			Our presence will be invisible,
			M'Lady.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I am very grateful you are here,
			Master Kenobi. The situation is
			more dangerous than the Senator
			will admit.

				PADMÉ
			I don't need more security, I need
			answers. I want to know who is
			trying to kill me.

				OBI-WAN
				(frowning)
			We're here to protect you
			Senator, not to start an
			investigation.

				ANAKIN
			We will find out who is trying to
			kill you Padmé, I promise you.

He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.

				OBI-WAN
			We are not going to exceed our
			mandate, my young Padawan learner.

				ANAKIN
			I meant in the interest of
			protecting her, Master, of course.

				OBI-WAN
			We are not going through this
			exercise again, Anakin. You will
			pay attention to my lead.

				ANAKIN
			Why?

				OBI-WAN
			What??!!

				ANAKIN
			Why else do you think we were
			assigned to her, if not to find
			the killer? Protection is a job
			for local security... not Jedi.
			It's overkill, Master.
			Investigation is implied in our
			mandate.

				OBI-WAN
			We will do as the Council has
			instructed, and you will learn
			your place, young one.

				PADMÉ
			Perhaps with merely your presence,
			the mysteries surrounding this
			threat will be revealed.  Now if
			you will excuse me I will retire.

Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Well, I know I feel a lot better
			having you here.
			I'll have an officer on every
			floor and I'll be at the command
			centre downstairs.

				JAR JAR 
			Mesa busten wit happiness seein
			Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad
			times, bombad times.

Captain Typho leaves.

				ANAKIN
			She didn't even recognise me, Jar
			Jar. I thought about her every
			day since we parted... and she's
			forgotten me completely.

				JAR JAR
			Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
			see-en her in longo time.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you're focusing on the
			Negative again. Be mindful of your
			thoughts. She was glad to see us.
			Now lets check the security here.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, my master.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - EVENING
The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a against the traffic-filled sky.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR - EVENING
MACE WINDU and YODA walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit room at the end.

				MACE WINDU
			Why couldn't we see this attack on
			the Senator?

				YODA
			Masking the future, is this
			disturbance in the Force.

				MACE WINDU
			The propecy is coming true, the
			Dark Side is growing.

				YODA
			And only those who have turned to
			the Dark Side can sense the
			possibilities of the future. Only
			going through the Dark Side can we
			see.

				MACE WINDU
			It's been ten years, and the Sith
			still have no shown themselves.
			Do you think they are behind this?

				YODA
			...Out there, they are. A
			certainty that is.

				MACE WINDU
			Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice
			will be able to bring balance to
			the Force?

				YODA
			Only if he chooses to follow his
			destiny.

There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT
ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.

The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.

				OBI-WAN
			Captain Typho has more than enough
			men downstairs. No assassin will
			try that way. Any activity up
			here?

				ANAKIN
			Quiet as a tomb. I don't like
			just waiting here for something to
			happen to her.

OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.

				OBI-WAN
			What's going on?

ANAKIN shrugs.

				ANAKIN
			She covered that camera. I don't
			think she liked me watching her.

				OBI-WAN
			What is she thinking?

				ANAKIN
			She programmed Artoo to warn us if
			there's an intruder.

				OBI-WAN
			It's not an intruder I'm worried
			about. There are many other ways
			to kill a Senator.

				ANAKIN
			I know, but we also want to catch
			this assassin. Don't we, Master?

				OBI-WAN
			You're using her as bait??

				ANAKIN
			It was her idea... No harm will
			come to her. I can sense
			everything going on in that room.
			Trust me.

				OBI-WAN
			It's too risky... and your senses
			aren't that attuned, young
			apprentice.

				ANAKIN
			And yours are?

				OBI-WAN
			Possibly.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.

ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.

				OBI-WAN 
			You look tired.

				ANAKIN
			I don't sleep well, anymore.

				OBI-WAN 
			Because of your mother?

				ANAKIN
			I don't know why I keep dreaming
			About her now. I haven't seen her
			since I was little.

				OBI-WAN
			Dreams pass in time.

				ANAKIN
			I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just
			Being around her again is...
			intoxicating.

				OBI-WAN
			Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they
			betray you. You've made a
			commitment to the Jedi order... a
			commitment not easily broken...
			and don't forget she's a
			politician. They're not to be
			trusted.

				ANAKIN 
			She's not like the others in the
			Senate, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			It's been my experience that
			Senators are only focused on
			pleasing those who fund their
			campaigns... and they are more
			than willing to forget the
			niceties of democracy to get those
			funds.

				ANAKIN
			Not another lecture, Master. Not
			on the economics of politics....
			It's too early in the morning... and
			besides, you're generalising. The
			Chancellor doesn't appear to
			be corrupt.

				OBI-WAN
			Palpatine's a politician, I've
			observed that he is very clever at
			following the passions and
			prejudices of the Senators.

				ANAKIN
			I think he is a good man. My
			instincts are very positive
			about...

ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN

				OBI-WAN
			I sense it, too.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.


OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.

EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.

				ANAKIN
			Stay here!

CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. 

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			I have a bad feeling about this.

FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.

				ANAKIN
			That was wacky! I almost lost you
			in the traffic.

				OBI-WAN
			What took you so long?

				ANAKIN
			Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
			find a speeder I really liked,
			with an open cockpit... and with
			the right speed capabilities...
			and then you know I had to get a
			really gonzo color...

They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.

				OBI-WAN
			If you'd spend as much time
			working on your saber skills as
			you do on your wit, young Padawan,
			you would rival Master Yoda as a
			swordsman.

				ANAKIN
			I thought I already did.

				OBI-WAN
			Only in your mind, my very young
			apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!

As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, I forgot you don't like
			flying, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			I don't mind flying... but
			what you're doing is suicide!

They barely miss a commuter train

				ANAKIN
			Master, you know I've been flying
			since before I could walk. I'm very
			good at this.

				OBI-WAN
			Just slow down!

ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Wait! Don't go in there!

ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			You know I don't like it when you
			do that!

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
			guy's gonna kill himself any
			minute now!

ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			What are you doing? He's gonna
			blast me!

				ANAKIN
			Right - this isn't working.

ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.

				OBI-WAN
			That was too close!

				ANAKIN
			Clear that!

				OBI-WAN
			What??

				ANAKIN
			Clear the flag! We're losing
			power! Hurry!

OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.

				OBI-WAN
			Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
			don't  like it when you do that!

				ANAKIN
			So sorry, Master.

They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.

				OBI-WAN
			It's dangerous near those power
			couplings! Slow down! Don't go
			through there!

Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Yiiii, what are you doing?

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master!

				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastically)
			Oh, that was good...

				ANAKIN
			That was crazy!!!

ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Ahh, damn.

				OBI-WAN
			Stop!!

				ANAKIN
			No, we can make it.

ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.

				OBI-WAN
			I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
			crazy.

				ANAKIN
			But it worked... we made it.

				OBI-WAN
				(angrily)
			It didn't work... we've stalled!
			And you almost got us killed!

				ANAKIN
			I think we're still alive.

ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.

				OBI-WAN
				(very angrily)
			It was stupid!

				ANAKIN
				(sheepishly)
			I could have made it...

				OBI-WAN
				(furious)
			But you didn't!!! And now we've
			lost him.

Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.

				ANAKIN
			No we didn’t...

Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right

				OBI-WAN
			Where are you going?! He went
			down there, the other way.

				ANAKIN
			This is a shortcut... I think.

				OBI-WAN
			What do you mean, ‘You think?’
			What kind of shortcut?! He went
			completely the other way! You’ve
			lost him!

				ANAKIN
			Master, if we keep this chase
			going, that creep’s gonna end up
			deep fried. Personally, I’d very
			much like to find out who in the
			hell he is and who he’s working
			for...

				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastic)
			Oh, so that’s why we’re going in
			the wrong direction.

ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Well, you lost him.

				ANAKIN
			I’m deeply sorry, Master.

ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to 
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Excuse me for a moment.

ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam’s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.

ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder’s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can’t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.

OBI-WAN has jumped into the driver’s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger’s seat.

ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM’S hand. She grabs the Jedi’s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it’s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder.

Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.

EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.

It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.

Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.

A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!

				ANAKIN
			She went into that club, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			Patience.

OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.

				OBI-WAN
			 	(continuing)
			Here. Next time try not to lose it.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.

				OBI-WAN
			A Jedi's saber is his most
			precious possession.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.

He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.

				OBI-WAN
			He must keep it with him at all
			times.

				ANAKIN
			I know, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			This weapon is your life!

				ANAKIN
			I've heard this lesson before...

OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.

				OBI-WAN
			But, you haven't learned anything,
			Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			I try, Master.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them

				OBI-WAN
			Why do I think you are going to be
			the death of me?!

				ANAKIN
			Don't say that Master... You're
			the closest thing I have to a
			father... I love you. I don't want
			to cause you pain.

				OBI-WAN
			Then why don't you listen to me?!

				ANAKIN
			I will. I'll do better, I promise.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you see him him?

				ANAKIN
			I think he's a she...

				OBI-WAN
			Then be extra careful...
				(nods to a room)
			Check it out.

OBI-WAN goes away.

				ANAKIN
			Where are you going, Master?

				OBI-WAN
			To get a drink.

OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.

CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.

				ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
			Wanna buy some death sticks?

OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.

				OBI-WAN
			You don't want to sell me death-
			sticks.

				ELAN
			I don't want to sell you death-
			sticks.

OBI-WAN moves his fingers.

				OBI-WAN
			You want to go home and rethink 
			your life.

				ELAN
			I want to go home and rethink my
			life.

He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.

CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.

ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.

				ANAKIN
			Easy... Official business. Go
			back to your drinks.

Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you know who it was you were
			trying to kill?

				ZAM WESSEL
			The Senator from Naboo.

				OBI-WAN
			Who hired you?

ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.

				ZAM WESSEL
			It was just a job.

				ANAKIN
			Tell us!

				ZAM WESSEL
			That Senator's gonna die soon
			anyway, and the next one won't
			make the same mistake I did...

				OBI-WAN
			This wound's going to need
			treatment.

				ANAKIN
			Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
			now!

ZAM glares hatefully.

				ZAM
			It was a Bounty Hunter called...

There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.

There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.

				OBI-WAN
			Toxic Dart...

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADME'S 
bedroom. PADME and DORME move about packing luggage.

				PADMÉ
			Representative Binks. I know I can
			count on you.

				JAR JAR
			Yousa betchen mesa bottums.

				PADMÉ
			What?!

				JAR JAR
				(coughs, recovers)
			Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
			I am honoured to accept this heavy
			burden. I take on this
			responsibility with deep humility
			tinged with an overwhelming pride.
				(pompously)
			It is not every day that I am
			called upon to...

PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.

				PADMÉ
			You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
			don't wish to hold you up. I'm
			sure you have a great deal to do.

				JAR JAR
			Of course, M'lady.

JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.

				PADMÉ
			I do not like this idea of hiding.

				ANAKIN
			Don't worry. Now that the Council
			has ordered an investigation, it
			won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
			find that bounty hunter.

				PADMÉ
				(frustrated)
			I haven't worked for a year to
			defeat the "Military Creation Act"
			not to be here when its fate is
			decided.

				ANAKIN
			Sometimes we have to let go of our
			pride and do what is requested of
			us.

				PADMÉ
			Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
			you don't have a very firm grip on
			politics. I suggest you reserve
			your opinions for some other time.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
			to...

				PADMÉ
			Annie! No!

				ANAKIN
			Please don't call me that.

				PADMÉ
			What?

				ANAKIN
			Annie...

				PADMÉ
			I've always called you that... it
			is your name, isn't it?

				ANAKIN
			It's Anakin. When you say Annie
			it's like I'm still a little
			boy... and I'm not.

				PADMÉ
			I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
			to deny you've...
				(looks him over)
			...that you've grown up.

PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.

				ANAKIN
			Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
			it...

				PADMÉ
			Mentors have a way of seeing more
			of our faults than we would like.
			It's the only way we grow.

				ANAKIN
			Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
			a great mentor. As wise as Master
			Yoda and as powerful as Master
			Windu. I am truly thankful to be
			his apprentice. Only... although
			I'm a Padawan learner, in some
			ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
			of him. I'm ready for the trials.
			I know I am! He knows it too. He
			believes I'm too unpredictable...
			Other Jedi my age have gone
			through the trials and made it...
			I know I started my training
			late... but he won't let me move
			on.

				PADMÉ
			That must be frustrating.

				ANAKIN
			It's worse... he's overly
			critical. He never listens! He
			just doesn't understand! It's not
			fair!

PADME cannot surpress a laugh. She shakes her head.

				PADMÉ
			I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
			like that little boy I once knew,
			when he didn't get his way.

				ANAKIN
			I'm not whining! I'm not.

PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.

				PADMÉ
			I didn't say it to hurt you.

				ANAKIN
			I know...

There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.

				PADME
			Anakin...

They look into each other's eyes for the first time.

				PADMÉ
				(continuing)
			Don't try to grow up too fast.

				ANAKIN
			I am grown up. You said it
			yourself.

ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes.

				PADMÉ
			Please don't look at me like that.

				ANAKIN
			Why not?

				PADMÉ
			Because I can see what you're
			thinking.

				ANAKIN
				(laughing)
			Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
			too?

DORME is watching with concern.

				PADMÉ
			It makes me feel uncomfortable.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady.

ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.

EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY 
A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang.

INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Be safe, m'lady.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Captain. Take good
			care of Dorme... the threat's on
			you two now.

				DORME
			He'll be safe with me.

They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep.

				PADMÉ
			You'll be fine.

				DORME
			It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
			about you. What if they realise
			I'm not you?

				PADMÉ
				(looks to Anakin)
			Then my Jedi protector will have
			to prove how grown up he is.

DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
			Do not attract any attention. Do
			absolutely nothing without
			checking in with me or the Council.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.

				OBI-WAN
				(to Padme)
			I will get to the bottom of this
			plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be
			back here in no time.

				PADMÉ
			I will be most grateful for your
			speed, Master Jedi.

				ANAKIN
			Time to go.

				PADMÉ
			I know. 

PADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them.

				OBI-WAN
			May the Force be with you.

				ANAKIN
			May the Force be with you, Master.

They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.

				PADMÉ
			Suddenly, I'm afraid...

				ANAKIN
			I'm kinda scared too. This is my
			first assignment on my own.

				PADMÉ
			There's nothing to worry about...
			we have Artoo with us.

The two laugh.

OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADME disappear into the 
vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.

				OBI-WAN
			I hope he doesn't try anything
			foolish.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I'd be more concerned about her
			doing something, than him.

EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS - CORUSCANT - DAY
The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant. It soon moves into the crowded skies.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY
From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI-WAN crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis Rooms.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.

				PK-4
			Place the subject for analysis on
			the sensot tray, please.

OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			It's a toxic dart. I need to know
			where it came from and who made it.

				PK-4
			One moment, please.

Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. They tray slides out.

				PK-4
				(continuing)
			As you can see on your screen,
			subject weapon does not exist in
			any known culture. Markings
			cannot be identified. Probablt
			self-made by a warrior not
			associated with any known society.

				OBI-WAN
			Excuse me? Could you try again
			please?

				PK-4
			Master Jedi, our records are very
			thorough. they cover eight
			percent of the galaxy. If I can't
			tell you where it came from,
			nobody can.

OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID.

				OBI-WAN
			Thanks for your assistance! You
			may not be able to figure this
			out, but I think I know someone
			who might.

EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER
The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.

INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
The great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.

				SERVER
			Keep moving! Keep moving!

ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.

				FOOD SERVER
				(continuing)
			Hey! No Droids!

ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.

				ANAKIN
			No, no, Mom, no...

He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			What?

				PADMÉ
			You seemed to be having a
			nightmare.

ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.

				PADMÉ
				(continuing)
			Are you hungry?

				ANAKIN
			Thank you.

				PADMÉ
			We went into lightspeed a while
			ago.

ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.

				ANAKIN
			I look forward to seeing Naboo
			again. I've thought about it every
			day since I left. It's by far the
			most beautiful place I've ever
			seen...

PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. 

				PADMÉ
			You were just a little boy then.
			It may not be as you remember it;
			time changes your perception.

				ANAKIN
			I think time has given me much
			more mature feelings to enhance my
			perception.

				PADMÉ
			It must be difficult having sworn
			your life to the Jedi... not being
			able to visit the places you
			like... or do the things you
			like...

				ANAKIN
			Or be with the people I love.

				PADMÉ
			Are you allowed to love? I
			thought that was forbidden for a
			Jedi.

				ANAKIN
			Attachment is forbidden.
			Possession is forbidden.
			Compassion, which I would define
			as unconditional love, is central
			to a Jedi's life, so you might say
			we're encouraged to love.

				PADMÉ
			You have changed so much

				ANAKIN
			You haven't changed a bit. You're
			exactly the way I remember you in
			my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
			changed much either.

				PADMÉ
			It hasn't...

				ANAKIN
			I can't wait to breathe the sweet
			breeze that comes off the rolling
			hills. Whenever I try to
			visualise the Force, those hills
			are what I see.

ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I love Naboo.

There is an awkward moment.

				PADMÉ
				(changing the subject)
			Were you dreaming about you
			mother earlier, weren't you?

				ANAKIN
			Yes... I left Tatooine so long
			ago, my memory of her is fading.
			I don't want to lose it. Recently
			I've been seeing her in my
			dreams... vivid dreams... scary
			dreams. I worry about her.

PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.

EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.

OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.

INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.

				HERMIONE
			Can I help ya?

				OBI-WAN
			I'm looking for Dexter.

HERMIONE'S eyes narrow.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Waddya want him for?

				OBI-WAN
			He's not in trouble. It's
			personal.

HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Someone to see ya, honey
				(lowering her voice)
			A Jedi, by the looks of him.

Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Obi-Wan!

				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Take a seat! Be right with ya!

OBI-WAN sits in a booth.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			You want a cup of ardees?

				OBI-WAN
			Thank you.

HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Hey, ol' buddy!

				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.

DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			So, my friend. What can I do for
			ya?

				OBI-WAN
			You can tell me what this is.

OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Well, whattaya know...

DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
				(continuing)
			I ain't seen one of these since I
			was prospecting on Subterrel
			beyond the Outer Rim!

				OBI-WAN
			Do you know where it came from?

DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			This baby belongs to them cloners.
			What you got here is a Kamino
			Kyberdart.

				OBI-WAN
			Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
			it didn't show up in any analysis
			archive.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It's these funny little cuts on
			the side give it away...
			Those analysis droids you've got
			over there only focus on symbols,
			you know. I should think you Jedi
			would have more respect for the
			difference between knowledge and
			wisdom.

				OBI-WAN
			Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
			wouldn't be here, would we?
				(laughing)
			Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
			Is it part of the Republic?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
			I'd say about twelve parsecs
			outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
			south. It should be easy to find,
			even for those droids in your
			archive to find. Those Kaminoans
			keep to themselves. They're
			cloners. Damned good ones, too.

OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.

				OBI-WAN
			Cloners? Are they friendly?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It depends.

				OBI-WAN
			On what, Dex?

Dexter grins. 

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			On how good your manners are...
			and how big your pocketbook is...

EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.

PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.

EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.

				ANAKIN
			If I grew up here, I don't think
			I'd ever leave.

				PADMÉ
				(laughing)
			I doubt that.

				ANAKIN
			No, really. When I started my
			training, I was very homesick and
			very lonely. This city and my Mom
			were the only pleasant things I
			had to think about... The problem
			was, the more I thought about my
			Mom, the worse I felt. But I
			would feel better if I thought
			about the palace - the way it
			shimmers in the sunlight - the way
			the air always smells of flowers...

				PADMÉ
			...and the soft sound of the
			distant waterfalls. The first
			time I saw the Capital, I was very
			young... I'd never seen a
			waterfall before. I though they
			were so beautiful... I never
			dreamed one day I'd live in the
			palace.

				ANAKIN
			Well, tell me, did you dream of
			power and politics when you were
			a little girl?

				PADMÉ
				(laughing)
			No! That was the last thing I
			thought of. My dream was to help
			in the "Refugee Relief Movement."
			I never thought of running for
			elected office. But the more
			history I studied, the more I
			realised how much good politicians
			could do. So when I was eight, I
			joined the "Apprentice
			Legislators", then later on became
			a Senatorial advisor, with such a
			passion that, before I knew it, I
			was elected Queen. Partly because
			I scored so high on my education
			certificate, but for the most part
			it was my conviction that reform
			was possible. I wasn't the
			youngest Queen ever elected, but
			now that I think back on it, I'm
			not sure I was old enough. I'm not
			sure I was ready.

				ANAKIN
			The people you served thought you
			did a good job. I heard they
			tried to amend the Constitution so
			you could stay in office.

				PADMÉ
			Popular rule is not democracy,
			Annie. It gives the people what
			they want, not what they need.
			And, truthfully, I was relieved
			when my two terms were up. So
			were my parents. They worried
			About me during the blockade and
			couldn't wait for it all to be
			over. Actually, I was hoping to
			have a family by now... My
			sisters have the most amazing,
			wonderful kids... but when the
			Queen asked me to serve as
			Senator, I couldn't refuse her.

				ANAKIN
			I agree! I think the Republic
			needs you... I'm glad you chose
			to serve. I feel things are going
			to happen in our generation that
			will change the galaxy in profound
			ways.

				PADMÉ
			I think so too.

ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.

INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We've been worried about you.
				(takes her hand)
			I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Your Highness. I only
			Wish I could have served you
			better by staying on Coruscant for
			the vote.

				SIO BIBBLE
			Given the circumstances, Senator,
			you know it was the only decision
			Her Highness could have made.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			How many systems have joined Count
			Dooku and the separatists?

				PADMÉ
			About two hundred. And more are
			leaving the Republic every day.
			If the Senate votes to create an
			army, I'm sure it's going to push
			us into a civil war.

				SIO BIBBLE
			It's unthinkable! There hasn't
			been a full-scale war since the
			formation of the Republic!

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Do you see any way, through
			negotiations, to bring the
			separatists back into the Republic?

				PADMÉ
			Not if they feel threatened. The
			separatists don't have an army,
			but if they are provoked, they
			will move to defend themselves.
			I'm sure of that. And with no time
			or money to build an army, my
			guess is they will turn to the
			Commerce Guilds or the Trade
			Federation for help.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			The armies of commerce! Why has
			Nothing been done in the Senate
			to restrain them?

				PADMÉ
			I'm afraid that, despite the
			Chancellor's best efforts, there
			are still many bureaucrats,
			judges, and even Senators on the
			payrolls of the Guilds.

				SIO BIBBLE
			It's outrageous! After all of
			those hearings, and the four trials in
			the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
			still the Viceroy of the Trade
			Federation. Do those money
			mongers control everything?

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Remember, Counsellor, the courts
			were able to reduce the
			Federation's armies. That's a
			move in the right
			direction.

				PADMÉ
			There are rumours, Your Highness,
			that the Federation Army was not
			reduced as they were ordered.

				ANAKIN
			The Jedi have not been allowed to
			investigate. It would be to be too
			dangerous for the economy, we were
			told.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We must keep our faith in the
			Republic. The day we stop
			believing democracy can work is
			the day we lose it.

				PADMÉ
			Let's pray that day never comes.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			In the meantime, we must consider
			your own safety.

SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin)
			What is your suggestion, Master
			Jedi?

				PADMÉ
			Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
			He's still a Padawan learner. I
			was thinking...

				ANAKIN
				(nettled)
			Hey, hold on a minute!

				PADMÉ
			Excuse me! I was thinking I would
			stay in the Lake Country. There
			are some places up there that are
			very isolated.

				ANAKIN
			Excuse me?! I am in charge of
			security here, M'Lady.

SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.

				PADMÉ
			Annie, my life is at risk, and
			this is my home. I know it very
			well... that is why we're here.
			I think it would be wise for you
			to take advantage of my knowledge
			in this instance.

				ANAKIN
				(takes a deep breath)
			Sorry, M'Lady.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin, amused)
			She is right. The Lake Country is
			the most remote part of Naboo.
			Not many people and a clear view
			of the surrounding terrain.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Perfect. It's settled then.

ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
				(continued)
			Padmé, I had an audience with your
			father yesterday. I told him what
			was happening. He hopes you will
			visit your mother before you
			leave... your family's very
			worried about you.

PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.

On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.

After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.

				JOCASTA NU
			Did you call for assistance?

				OBI-WAN
				(distracted in thought)
			Yes... yes, I did...

				JOCASTA NU
			He has a powerful face, doesn't
			he? He was one of the most
			brilliant Jedi I have had the
			privilege of knowing.

				OBI-WAN
			I never understood why he quit.
			Only twenty Jedi have ever left
			the Order.

				JOCASTA NU
				(sighs)
			The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
			was the most recent and the most
			painful. No one likes to talk
			about it. His leaving was a great
			loss to the Order.

				OBI-WAN
			What happened?

				JOCASTA NU
			Well, one might say, he was always
			a bit out of step with the
			decisions of the Council... much
			like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

				OBI-WAN
				(surprised)
			Really?

				JOCASTA NU
			Oh, yes. They were alike in many
			ways. Very individual thinkers...
			idealists...

JOCASTA NU stares at the bust

				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing
			He was always striving to become
			a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
			to be the best. With a lightsaber,
			in the old style of fencing, he
			had no match. His knowledge of
			the Force was... unique. In the
			end, I think he left because he
			lost faith in the Republic. He
			believed that politics were
			corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
			betrayed themselves by serving the
			politicians. He always had very
			high expectations of government.
			He disappeared for nine or ten
			years, then he just showed up
			recently as the head of the
			separatist movement.

				OBI-WAN
			Interesting... I'm still not sure
			I understand.

				JOCASTA NU
			Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
			over here for a history lesson.
			Are you having a problem, Master
			Kenobi?

				OBI-WAN
			Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
			system called Kamino. It doesn't
			seem to show upon any of the
			archive charts.

				JOCASTA NU
			Kamino? It's not a system I'M
			familiar with... Let me see...

JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.

				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing)
			Are you sure you have the right
			co-ordinates?

				OBI-WAN
				(nodding)
			According to my information, it
			should be in this quadrant
			somewhere... just south of the
			Rishi Maze.

JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.

				JOCASTA NU
			No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
			kind of directions you'd get from
			a street tout... some old miner or
			Furbog trader.

				OBI-WAN
			All three actually.

				JOCASTA NU
			Are you sure it exists?

				OBI-WAN
			Absolutely.

				JOCASTA NU
			Let me do a gravitational scan.

OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.

				JOCASTA NU
			There are some inconsistencies
			here. Maybe the planet you're
			looking for was destroyed.

				OBI-WAN
			Wouldn't that be on record?

				JOCASTA NU
			It ought to be. Unless it was very
			recent.
				(shakes her head)
			I hate to say it, but it looks
			like the system you're searching
			for doesn't exist.

				OBI-WAN
			That's impossible... perhaps the
			archives are incomplete.

				JOCASTA NU
			The archives are comprehensive and
			totally secure, my young Jedi.
			One thing you may be absolutely
			sure of - if an item does not
			appear in our records, it does not
			exist!

OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.

EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON
PEOPLE are passing through the little street, OLD MEN are sunning themslves, WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN, PADME and ARTOO turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his Jedi robes. PADME wear a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.

				PADME
			There's my house!

PADME starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			What? Don't say you're shy!

				ANAKIN
				(untruthfully)
			No, but I...

Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME.

				RYOO & POOJA
			Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!

				PADME
			Ryoo!! Pooja!!

PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			I'm so happy to see you! This is
			Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and
			this is Pooja.

ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:

				RYOO & POOJA
			Artoo!!!

As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
SOLA, PADME'S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.

				SOLA
				(over her shoulder)
			They're eating over at Jev
			Narran's later, Mom. They just
			had a snack. They'll be fine.

SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room.

				PADME
			Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.

				SOLA
			Hello, Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			Hello.

SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.

				JOBAL
			You're just in time for dinner. I
			hope you're hungry, Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			A little.

				PADME
			He's being polite, Mom. We're
			starving.

				RUWEE
				(grinning)
			You came to the right place at the
			right time. Sit down, son.

EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.

				JOBAL
				(to Padme)
			Honey, it's so good to see you
			safe. We were so worried.

PADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches.

				RUWEE
			Dear...

				JOBAL
			I know, I know... but I had to say
			it. Now it's done.

				SOLA
			Well, this is exciting! Do you
			know, Anakin, you're the first
			boyfriend my sister's ever brought
			home?

				PADME
				(rolls her eyes)
			Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!
			He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate
			to protect me.

				JOVAL
			A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They
			didn't tell us it was that serious!

				PADME
			It's not, Mom, I promise.
				(glances at Jobal)
			Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've
			known him for years. Remember
			that little boy who was with the
			Jedi during the blockade crisis?

They nod.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			He grew up.

				JOBAL
			Honey, when are you going to
			settle down? Haven't you had
			enough of that life? I certainly
			have!

				PADME
			Mom, I'm not in any danger.

				RUWEE
				(to Anakin)
			Is she?

				ANAKIN
			...Yes... I'm afraid she is.

				PADME
				(quickly)
			But not much.

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking.

				RUWEE
			Sometimes I wish I'd traveled
			more... but I must say, I'm happy
			here.

				ANAKIN
			Padme tells me you teach at the
			university?

				RUWEE
				(nodding)
			Yes, and before that, I was a
			builder. I also worked for the
			Refugee Relief Movement, when I
			was very young.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table.

				SOLA
			Why haven't you told us about him?

				PADMÉ
			What's there to talk about?  He's
			just a boy.

				SOLA
			A boy? Have you seen the way he
			looks at you?

				PADMÉ
			Sola - stop it!

				SOLA
			It's obvious he has feelings for
			you. Are you saying, little baby
			sister, that you haven't noticed?

				PADMÉ
			I'm not your baby sister, Sola.
			Anakin and I are friends... our
			relationship is strictly
			professional.
				(to Jobal)
			Mom, would you tell her to stop it?

				SOLA
				(laughing)
			Well, maybe you haven't noticed
			the way he looks at you. I think
			you're afraid to.

				PADMÉ
			Cut it out.

				JOBAL
			Sola's just concerned... we all
			are.

				PADMÉ
			Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What
			I'm doing is important.

				JOBAL
			You've done your service, Padmé.
			It's time you had a life of your
			own. You're missing so much!

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and faces ANAKIN directly.

				RUWEE
			Now tell me, son. How serious is
			this thing? How much danger is my
			daughter really in?

				ANAKIN
			There have been two attempts on
			her life. Chances are there'll be
			more. My Master is tracking down
			the assassins. I'm sure he'll find
			out who they are. This situation,
			won't last long.

				RUWEE
			I don't want anything to happen to
			her.

				ANAKIN
			I don't either.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME throws some things into a bag.

				PADME
			Don't worry, this won't take long.

				ANAKIN
			I just want to get there before
			dark.

PADME goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the room.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			You still live at home.

				PADME
			I move around so much, I've never
			had a place of my own. Official
			residences have no warmth. I feel
			good here. I feel at home.

				ANAKIN
			I never had a real home. Home was
			always where my Mom was.

ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Is this you?

The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.

				PADME
			That was when I went with the
			Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
			Their sun was imploding, and the
			planet was dying. I was helping
			to relocate the children. See
			that little one I'm holding? His
			name was N'a-kee-tula, which means
			sweethear. He was so full of 
			life,. All those kids were. I did
			everything I could to save him,
			but he died... they all did. They
			were never able to adapt... to
			live off their native planet.

ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			My first day as an Apprentice
			Legislator. Notice the difference?

PADME pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.

				YODA
			Don't think... feel... be as one
			with the Force. Help you, it will.
				(he sees Obi-Wan)
			Younglings - enough! A visitor we
			have. Welcome him.

The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
			mighty Bear Clan.

				CHILDREN
			Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!

				OBI-WAN
			I am sorry to disturb you, Master.

				YODA
			What help to you, can I be?

				OBI-WAN
			I’m looking for a planet described
			to me by an old friend. I trust
			him. But the system doesn’t show
			up on the archive maps.

				YODA
			An interesting puzzle. Gather
			round the map reader, younglings.
			Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
			Find it, we will try...

The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.

				OBI-WAN
			This is where it ought to be...
			but it isn’t. Gravity is pulling
			all the stars in this area inward
			to this spot. There should be a
			star here... but there isn’t.

				YODA
			Most interesting. Gravity’s
			silhouette remains, but the star
			and all its planets have
			disappeared. How can this be?

There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.

				JEDI CHILD JACK
			Because someone erased it from the
			archive memory.

				CHILDREN
			That’s right! Yes! That’s what
			happened! Someone erased it!

				JEDI CHILD MAY
			If the planet blew up, the gravity
			would go away.

OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.

				YODA
			Truly wonderful, the mind of a
			child is. Uncluttered. To the
			centre of the pull of gravity go,
			and find your planet you will.

				OBI-WAN
			But Master Yoda who could have
			erased information from the
			archives? That’s impossible,
			isn’t it?

				YODA
				(frowning)
			Much harder to answer, that
			question is.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge.

ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.

				PADMÉ
			When I was in Level Three, we used
			to come here for school retreat.
			See that island? We used to swim
			there every day. I love the water.

				ANAKIN
			I do too. I guess it comes from
			growing up on a desert planet.

PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.

				PADMÉ
			...We used to lie on the sand and
			let the sun dry us... and try to
			guess the names of the birds
			singing.

				ANAKIN
			I don’t like sand. It’s coarse
			and rough and irritating, and it
			gets everywhere. Not like here.
			Here everything’s soft... and
			smooth...

He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.

				PADMÉ
			There was a very old man who lived
			on the island. He used to make
			glass out of sand - and vases and
			necklaces out of the glass. They
			were magical.

				ANAKIN
				(looks into her eyes)
			Everything here is magical.

				PADMÉ
			You could look into the glass and
			see the water. The way it ripples
			and moves. It looked so real...
			but it wasn’t.

				ANAKIN
			Sometimes, when you believe
			something to be real, it becomes
			real. Real enough, anyway...

They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.

				PADMÉ
			I used to think if you looked too
			deeply into glass, you would
			lose yourself.

				ANAKIN
			I think it's true...

ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.

				PADMÉ
			I shouldn't have done that.

				ANAKIN
			I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
			my mind is no longer my own.

				PADMÉ
			It's the situation... the stress...

He looks at her.

				ANAKIN
			...the view.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it.

				MACE WINDU
			Be wary, this disturbance in the
			Force is growing stronger.

				OBI-WAN
			I am concerned for my Padawan. He
			is not ready to be on his own.

				YODA
			The Council is confident in this decision,
			Obi-Wan.

				MACE
			He has exceptional skills. The
			Council is confident in its
			decision, Obi-Wan. If the
			prophecy is true, he weill be the
			one to bring balance to the Force.

				OBI-WAN
			But he still has much to learn.
			And his abilities have made him...
			well... arrogant. I realise now
			what you and Master Yoda knew from
			the beginning... the boy was too
			old to start the training and...

OBI-WAN hesitates.

				MACE WINDU
			There's something else?

				OBI-WAN
			Master, he should not have been
			given this assignment. I'm afraid
			Anakin won't be able to protect
			the Senator. 

				MACE WINDU
			Why?

				OBI-WAN
			He has a... an emotional
			connection with her. It's been
			there since he was boy. Now
			he's confused... distracted.

				MACE-WINDU
			Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
			he will take the right path.

OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.

				OBI-WAN
			Has Master Yoda gained any insight
			into whether or not this war will
			come about?

				MACE WINDU
			Probing the Dark Side is a
			dangerous process. He could be in
			seclusion for days... May the
			force be with you.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.

				PADME
			You did that?

ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.

				ANAKIN
			What?

PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.

				PADME
			That! Now stop it!

PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			Anakin!!

ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.

				ANAKIN
			I'm not really supposed to do
			that... for fun, I mean. If
			Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
			very grumpy.

ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.

She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.

				ANAKIN
			May I tell you something?

				PADME
			I don't know.

				ANAKIN
			Then how can I tell you?

				PADME
			Maybe you should use your Jedi
			intuition.

				ANAKIN
			It doesn't work around you. My
			mind is always a muddle... I can
			only think of you.

				PADME
			Anakin, don't...

				ANAKIN
			From the moment I met you, all
			those years ago, a day hasn't gone
			by when I haven't thought of you.
			And now that I'm close to you again,
			I'm in agony. The closer I get to
			you, the worse it gets. The
			thought of not being with you
			mskes my stomach turn over - my
			mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
			can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
			kiss you should never have given
			me. My heart is beating, hoping
			that kiss will not become a scar.
			You are in my very soul,
			tormenting me. What can I do? I
			will do anything you ask...

Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			If you are suffering as much as I
			am, tell me.

				PADME
			...I can't. We can't. It's just
			not possible.

				ANAKIN
			Anything's possible. Padme,
			please listen...

				PADME
			You listen. We live in a real
			world. Come back to it. You're
			studying to become a Jedi Knight.
			I'm a Senator. If you follow your
			thoughts through to conclusion,
			they will take us to a place we
			cannot go... regardless of the way
			we feel about each other.

				ANAKIN
			Then you do feel something!
			There's an extraordinary
			connection between us. You can't
			deny that.

				PADME
			Annie, it doesn't make any
			difference. Jedi aren't allowed
			to marry. You swore an oath,
			remember? You'd be expelled from
			the Order. I will not let you
			give up your responsibilities...
			your future, for me.

				ANAKIN
			I was destined to be a Jedi. I
			don't think I could be anything
			else. But you are asking me to be
			rational. That is something I
			know I cannot do. I wish I could
			wish my feelings away... but I
			can't.

				PADME
			I am not going to give into this.
			I'm not going to throw my life
			away. I have more important things
			to do than fall in love.

There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.

				ANAKIN
			It wouldn't have to be that way...
			we could keep it a secret.

				PADME
			Then we'd be living a lie - one we
			couldn't keep even if we wanted
			to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
			mother. I couldn't do that.
			Could you, Anakin? Could you live
			like that?

Silence for a moment.

				ANAKIN
			...No, you're right. It would
			destroy us.

EXT. SPACE
It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.

The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.

				TAUN WE
			Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
			Jedi.

OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.

				TAUN WE
			Everything is ready. The Prime
			Minister expects you.

				OBI-WAN
				(warily)
			I'm expected?

				TAUN WE
			Of course! He is anxious to see
			you. After all these years, we
			were beginning to think you
			weren't coming. Now please, this
			way!

OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.

Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY
The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.

				TAUN WE
			May I present Lama Su, Prime
			Minister of Kamino... and this is
			Master Jedi...

				OBI-WAN
			Obi-Wan Kenobi.

				LAMA SU
			Please...

LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.

				LAMA SU
			I trust you are going to enjoy
			your stay. We are most happy you
			have arrived at the best part of
			the season.

				OBI-WAN
			You make me feel most welcome.

				LAMA SU
			And now to business. You will be
			delighted to hear we are on
			schedule. Two hundred thousand
			units are ready, with another
			million well on the way.

				OBI-WAN
				(improvising)
			That is... good news.

				LAMA SU
			Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
			that we have every confidence his
			order will be met on time and in
			full. He is well, I hope?

				OBI-WAN
			I'm sorry Master - ?

				LAMA SU
			Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
			a leading member of the Jedi
			Council, is he not?

				OBI-WAN
			Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.

				LAMA SU
				(rising)
			You must be anxious to inspect the
			units for yourself.

				OBI-WAN
			That's why I'm here.

EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly.

Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers.

				PADMÉ
			I don't know...

				ANAKIN
			Sure you do... you just don't want
			to tell me.

				PADMÉ
			Are you going to use one of your
			Jedi mind tricks on me?

				ANAKIN
			They only work on the weak-minded.
			You are anything but weak-minded.

				PADMÉ
			All right... his name was Palo.
			I was twelve. We were both in the
			Legislative Youth Program. He was
			a few years older then I... very
			cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
			eyes.

				ANAKIN
			All right, I get the picture...
			whatever happened to him?

				PADMÉ
			I went on to become a Queen. He
			went on to become an artist.

				ANAKIN
			Maybe he was the smart one.

				PADME
			You really don't like politicians,
			do you?

				ANAKIN
			I like two or three, but I'm not
			really sure about one of them.
				(smiling)
			I don't think the system works.

				PADME
			How would you have it work?

				ANAKIN
			We need a system where the
			politicians sit down and discuss
			the problems, agree what's in the
			best interests of all the people,
			and then do it.

				PADME
			That is exactly what we do. The
			trouble is that people don't
			wlways agree. In fact, they
			hardly ever do.

				ANAKIN
			Then they should be made to.

				PADME
			By whom? Who's going to make them?

				ANAKIN
			I don't know. Someone.

				PADME
			You?

				ANAKIN
			Of course not me.

				PADME
			But someone.

				ANAKIN
			Someone wise.

				PADME
			That sounds an awful lot like a
			dictatorship to me.

A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.

				ANAKIN
			Well, if it works...

PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.

				PADMÉ
			You're making fun of me.

				ANAKIN
			 	(sarcastic)
			On no, I'd be much too frightened
			to tease a Senator.

				PADMÉ
			You're so bad!

PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.

				ANAKIN
			You're always so serious. Always
			carrying the weight of the
			universe on your shoulders.

ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.

ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.

The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.

ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.

				LAMA SU
				(beaming)
			Magnificent, aren't they?

OBI-WAN nods slowly.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY
LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.

				LAMA SU
			We modified their genetic
			structure to make them less
			independent than the original
			host. As a result they are
			totally obedient, taking any order
			without question.

				OBI-WAM
			Who was the original host?

				LAMA SU
			A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
			We felt a Jedi would be the
			perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
			picked Jango Fett himself.

				OBI-WAN
			Where is this bounty hunter now?

				LAMA SU
			Oh, we keep him here. After a few
			hundred thousand clones, the
			genetic pattern starts to fade, so
			we take a fresh supply. He lives
			here, but he's free to come and go
			as he pleases.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.

				LAMA SU
			Apart from his pay, which is
			considerable, Fett demanded only
			one thing - an unaltered clone for
			himself. Curious isn't it?

				OBI-WAN
			Unaltered?

				LAMA SU
			Pure genetic replication. No
			tampering with the structure to
			make it more docile... and no
			growth acceleration...

				OBI-WAN
			I would like to meet this Jango
			Fett.

				TAUN WE
			I would be most happy to arrange
			it, for you.

TAUN WE bows, and leaves.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			You mentioned growth
			acceleration...

				LAMA SU
			Oh yes, it's essential.
			Otherwise, a mature clone would
			take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
			can do it in half the time. Those
			items you saw on the parade ground
			were started ten years ago, when
			Sido-dyas first placed the order,
			and they're already mature...

OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			And these?

				LAMA SU
			About five years ago.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.

				LAMA SU
			They're immensely superior to
			droids, capable of independent
			thought and action.

				OBI-WAN
			Very impressive.

				LAMA SU
			I'd hoped you would be pleased. 

OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.

				OBI-WAN
				(carefully)
			Tell me, prime minister, when my
			Master Sido-dyas first contacted
			you, did he say the order was
			for... himself... or?

				LAMA SU
			Himself? Of course not. This
			army is for the Republic?

				OBI-WAN
				(astonished)
			The Repubic?

				LAMA SU
			We are also very much agasint this
			Count Dooku and his seccessionist
			movement. We are proud to be of
			help to the Republic.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.

				TAUN WE
			I have arranged for you to meet
			Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
			well.

TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, Arfour...

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
The R4 D17, Obi-Wan's Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi-Wan's Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, relay this, "scramble code
			five," to Courscant: care of "the
			old folks home."

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING
YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands between them broadcasting the massage. The singnal is very weak, the image fades in and out.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			...I've never heard of a Jedi
			called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?

				MACE WINDU
			No. Whoever placed that order was
			not a Jedi, I can assure you.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I have a strong feeling that this
			bounty hunter is the assassin
			we're looking for.

				YODA
			Who he is working for... discover
			that, you must.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I will, Master, and I will also
			find out more about this clone
			army... May The Force...

The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away.

				WINDU 
			A clone army! Ordered by someone
			in the Senate perhaps... Someone's
			out to start a war.

				YODA
			Inform the chancellor of this, we
			must.

				WINDU
			Who do you think this impostor
			Sido-Dyas, could be?

YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT - NIGHT
The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat 
forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.

				ANAKIN
			No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
			no, don't!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING
ANAKIN is on the balcony overlooking the gardens. After a moment, PAMDE comes onto the balcony behind him. She sees he is meditating and turns to go.

				ANAKIN
				(eyes closed)
			Don't go.

				PAMDE
			I don't want to disturb you.

				ANAKIN
			Your presence is soothing.

Brief pause.

				PADME
			You had a nightmare again last
			night.

				ANAKIN
			Jedi don't have nightmares.

				PADME
			I heard you.

ANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her.

				ANAKIN
			I saw my mother. I saw her as
			clearly as I see you now. She's
			suffering, Padme. She is in
			pain...They're killing her!
				(getting up)
			I know I'm disobeying my mandate
			to protect you, Senator. I know I
			will be punished and possibly
			thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
			I must go. I have to help her!
			I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
			choice.

				PADME
			Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
			you give up your future for me.
			I'll go with you. That way you
			can continue to protect me, and
			you won't be disobeying your
			mandate.

				ANAKIN
			What about Master Obi-wan?

PADME smiles and takes his hand.

				PADME
			I guess we won't tell him, will we?

EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts.

PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS.

As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom.

				TAUN WE
			Boba, is your father here?

There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.

				TAUN WE
				(continuing)
			May we see him?

				BOBA FETT
			Sure.

Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks around the room.

				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Taun We's here!

JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.

				TAUN WE
			Welcome back, Jango. Was your
			trip productive?

				JANGO FETT
			Fairly.

OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.

				TAUN WE
			This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
			Kenobi. He's come to check on our
			progress.

				JANGO FETT
			That right?

JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.

				OBI-WAN
			Your clones are very impressive.
			You must be very proud.

				JANGO FETT
			I'm just a simple man, trying to
			make my way in the universe,
			Master Jedi.

				OBI-WAN
			Aren't we all?

OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Ever made your way as far into the
			interior as Coruscant?

				JANGO
			Once or twice.

				OBI-WAN
			Recently?

				JANGO
				(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
			Possibly...

				OBI-WAN
			Then you must know Master Sido-
			Dyas?

				JANGO
			Boba, close the door.

BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.

				JANGO
				(continuing)
			Master who?

				OBI-WAN
			Sido-Dyas. Isn’t he the Jedi who
			hired you for this job?

				JANGO
			Never heard of him. I was
			recuited by a man called Darth
			Tyranus on one of the moons of
			Bogden.

				OBI-WAN
			No? I thought...

				TAUN WE
			Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
			And he showed up just when your
			Jedi Master said he would. We
			have kept the Jedi’s involvement
			a secret until your arrival, just
			as your Master requested.

				OBI-WAN
			Curious...

				JANGO
			Do you like your army?

				OBI-WAN
			It seems to me it's your army -
			being that they are all clones of
			you.

				JANGO
				(grinning)
			They'll do their job well, I'll
			guarantee that.

				OBI-WAN
			I look forward to seeing them in
			action. Thank you for your time,
			Jango.

				JANGO
			Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.

				BOBA
			What is it, Dad?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY
The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. Finally, they come  to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops.

				ANAKIN
				(to the droid driver)
			Wait, please.

ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.

				WATTO
				(yelling, in Huttese)
			No, not that one - that one!

				ANAKIN
				(arriving)
			Excuse me, Watto.

				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			What?

				ANAKIN
				(in Huttese)
			I said excuse me.

WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.

				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			Shut down.

The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.

				WATTO
				(continuing, in Huttese)
			What? I don't know you... What can
			I do for you? You look like a
			Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
			do it.

WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese

				ANAKIN
			Let me help you with that.

ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to ANAKIN.

				WATTO
			Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!

Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.

				WATTO
				(continuing; in English)
			You are Annie! It is you! You
			little womp rat.

WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.

				WATTO
				(continuing)
			You sure sprouted Weehoo! A
			Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe
			you couldda help wit some
			daedbeats who owe...

				ANAKIN
			My mother...

				WATTO
			Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine
			no more. I sold her.

				ANAKIN
			Sold her...

				WATTO
			Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
			know, business is business.
			Sold her to a moisture farmer
			named Lars. Least I think it was
			Lars. Believe it or not, I heard
			he freed her and married her. Can
			ya beat that?

				ANAKIN
			Do you know where they are?

				WATTO
			Long way from here... someplace
			over on the other side of Mos
			Eisley, I think...

				ANAKIN
			I'd like to know.

ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.

				WATTO
			Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
			go look in my records.

ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door.

				LAMA SU
			Tell your Council the first
			battalions are ready. And remind
			them that if they need more
			troops, we will need time to grow
			them.

				OBI-WAN
			I won't forget.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.

Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.

OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:

				BOBA FETT
			Dad!!

JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.

JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.

The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.

JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.

IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.

IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.

OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.

The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.

JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.

OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.

Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.

OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.

JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.

OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:

A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY
The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.

				PADME
			Stay with the ship, Artoo.

ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the homestead.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and PADME arrive,

				C-3PO
			Good evening. May I help you?

				ANAKIN
			Threepio?

				C-3PO
			Oh, my... oh, my! Master
			Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly
			believe it! And this must be Miss
			Padme.

				PADME
			Hello, Threepio.

				ANAKIN
			I've come to see my mother.

				C-3PO
			Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,
			Master Annie.

				PADME
			Threepio, what's happened?

				C-3PO
			I think we'd better go inside.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles ahead.

				C-3PO
			Master Lars - Master Owen!
			Somebody to see you!

OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.

				ANAKIN
			I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here
			looking for my mother.

				OWEN
			Owen Lars... I guess I'm your
			step-brother.
				(they shake hands)
			This is my girlfriend, Beru.

				BERU
			Hello.

				PADME
			I'm Padme.

				OWEN
			I had a feeling you might show up
			some day.

				ANAKIN
			Is my mother here?

				CLIEGG
			No, she's not.

CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.

				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
			Come on inside. We have a lot to
			talk about.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY
BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen...

				CLIEGG (O.S.)
			It was just before dawn. They
			came out of nowhere. A hunting
			party of Tusekn Raiders.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY
CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen.

				CLIEGG
			Your mother had gone out early,
			like she always did, to pick
			mushrooms that grow on the
			vaporatos. From the tracks, she
			was about halfway when they
			took her. Those Tuskens walk like
			men, but they're vicious, mindless
			monsters. Thirty of us went out
			after her. Four of us came back.
			Three more are still out there
			looking. I'd be with them,
			only... I just couldn't ride any
			more... until I heal.

CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.

				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			This isn't the way I wanted to
			meet you, son. This isn't how
			your mother and I planned it. I
			don't want to give up on her, but
			she's been gone a month. There's
			little hope she's lasted this long.

Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.

				OWEN
			Where are you going?

				ANAKIN
			To find my mother.

				PADME
			No, Annie!

				CLIEGG
			She's daed, son. Accept it.

				ANAKIN
			I can feel her pain, and I will
			find her. I know she's alive.

ANAKIN turns abruptly.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME.

				ANAKIN
			You are going to have to stay
			here. These are good people,
			Padme. You'll be safe.

				OWEN
			Take my speeder bike.

				PADME
			Anakin...

PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by.

				ANAKIN
			I trust you'll watch over her,
			Owen.

				OWEN
			Don't worry.

ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.

				ANAKIN
			I won't be long.

ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it.

INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS
JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT.

				JANGO FETT
			Nearly there, son.

JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:

				BOBA FETT
			Dad, look!!

On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.

				JANGO FETT
			Hang on!

The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.

Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.

In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.

				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Watch out!

				JANGO FETT
			Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
			That Jedi won't be able to follow
			us through this.

But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.

IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.

IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.

				BOBA FETT
			Got him! Yeahhhhh!

				JANGO FETT
			We won't see him again.

BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET
ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed.

EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT
ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance.

He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO EOPIES are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder.

EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal HOWLS.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence. Then:

				C-3PO
			Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.
			These people need your help.

THREEPIO is parked in a corner.

				PADME
			I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just
			can't sleep.

				C-3PO
			That's something I cannot relate
			to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm
			either active or inactive.
			There's no in-between.

				PADME
			I guess you're lucky.

				C-3PO
			Do you really think so..? I
			suppose I shouldn't expect...

				PADME
			You're not happy here?

				C-3PO
			Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my
			masters here ar so kind I
			wouldn't wish to trouuble them,
			it's just... being like this...
			well, it's embarrassing.

				PADME
			Being like what?

				C-3PO
			Naked. If you pardon the
			expression. You see, when Master
			Annie made me, he never quite
			found the time to give me any
			outer covering. It's so
			humiliating. How would you like it
			if you had to go around with all
			your circuits showing?

				PADME
			I guess I wouldn't like it at all.

				C-3PO
			Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
			would. It's simply not protocol.

PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.

				PADME
			Maybe we can do something about it.

				C-3PO
			I don't think so. Only Master
			Annie...

				PADME
			Why not? They seem to have a box
			of old coverings here.

				C-3PO
			Oh? How observant of you, Miss
			Padme. Of course, I'm just not
			mechanically minded... if you see
			what I mean.

PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.

				PADME
			Let's see, if we put this...
			here...

				C-3PO
			Ooooh! That's tickles.

				PADME
			You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.
			Hold still, please.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock.

INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts the engines of his fighter.

Obi-Wan's Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
Obi-Wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around.

Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.

The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.

OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it.

He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.

A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.

EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.

INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.

A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.

He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been 
terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.

				ANAKIN
			Mom... Mom... Mom... 

SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.

				SHMI
			Annie...? Is it you?

SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.

				ANAKIN
			I’m here, Mom. You’re safe. Hang
			on. I’m going to get you out of
			here...

				SHMI
			I’m so glad... to see you,
			Annie... Now... I am complete...

				ANAKIN
			Just stay with me, Mom. I’m going
			to make you well again.
			Everything’s going to be fine.

				SHMI
			You look so handsome. My son...
			my grown-up son. I’m so proud of
			you, Annie... so proud... I missed
			you so much... I love...

SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.

OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.

SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.

As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin’s lightsaber switches on.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			"Guiding light" to "old folks
			home."

EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building.

INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE
A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.

				OBI-WAN
			...Starships from the Trade
			Federation and the Commerce Guilds
			are taking deliveries of battle
			droids from the foundries on
			Geonosis.

				BAIL ORGANA
			That's outrageous! The treaty
			forbids the Trade Federation from
			building up an army. What are
			they doing?!

				OBI-WAN
			The droid foundry seems to be
			working at full capacity. I am
			going to go down and investigate.
			I will bring Jango Fett back home
			for interrogation.

				PALPATINE
			Those Geonosian foundries are part
			of the Techno Union. We will call
			in their representatives and ask
			them a few very pointed questions.

				OBI-WAN
			One more thing. Jango mentioned
			he was recruited by someone named
			Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
			might be?

				YODA
			With the forename Darth, a Sith he
			must be.

				MACE WINDU
			Our missing apprentice. They are
			playing their hand at last.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you believe he could be the
			mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
			deal for the clone army?

				YODA
			Perhaps too many pieces are missing
			from this puzzle, there are.

				MACE WINDU
			Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
			investigation is becoming less
			than routine. Do you need help?

				OBI-WAN
			Let me see if I can figure out
			what's going on first.

The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.

				BAIL ORGANA
			The Commerce Guilds are preparing
			for war... there can be no doubt
			of that.

				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku must have made a
			treaty with them.

				MACE WINDU
			We must stop them soon before
			they're fully ready.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			The debate is over, we need
			that clone army now!

				BAIL ORGANA
			Unfortunately, the debate is not
			over. The Senate will never be
			able to approve the use of that
			army before the separatists
			attack.

Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.

				MAS AMEDDA
			This is a crisis! If the Senate
			votes the Chancellor emergency
			powers, he could approve the use
			of the army in a minute.

				PALPATINE
			Please, please, I don't wish to
			have emergency powers. That's too
			extreme a solution. It's akin to
			a dictatorship. We must rely on
			the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
			are available to go to Geonosis?

MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.

				YODA
			Two Hundred,... less or more.

				BAIL ORGANA
			With all due respect for the Jedi
			Order, two hundred will be no
			match for hundreds of thousands of
			battle droids.

				MACE WINDU
			Patience. We should wait for Obi-
			Wan to report back. We don't know
			that Count Dooku has made a treaty
			with the Corporate Alliance, it's
			speculation.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			But we must prepare for the worst.
			I'm going to propose a motion
			granting emergency powers to the
			Chancellor at the next session. We
			must not wait!

				PALPATINE
			Out of the question, Senator! You
			and I are too closely aligned.
			The issue will become partisan and
			debates will begin. The proposal
			must come from a neutral source.

				MAS AMEDDA
			If only Senator Amidala were here.

JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.

				JAR JAR
			Supreme Chancellor... my august
			colleagues, I would be proud to
			propose the motion in question.
			This is a grave situation, and I'm
			sure Senator Amidala, and the
			Queen of Naboo would agree.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			Thank you, Representative Binks.

Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.

				PALPATINE
			If called upon, I will serve. But
			it will be the saddest day of my
			life.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - DAY
All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
PADME fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.

				PADME
			There!

PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.

				C-3PO
			Um. How do I look?

				OWEN
			Great! You look perfect.

				C-3PO
			Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so
			happy!
				(extending his hand to shake hers)
			Oh, pardon me.

THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.

				THREEPIO
				(continuing)
			Thank you.

He forgets formality and hugs her. PADME hugs him back, laughing.

				C-3PO
				(continuing)
			Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

				OWEN
				(grinning)
			Well, Padme, I think he should be
			yours from now on... I know that
			is what my Mom would want.

				C-3PO
			Oh, my!

Then suddenly, from outside:

				BERU (V.O.)
			Come topside, everybody! He's
			back! He's back!

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO watch the flickering image.

				OBI-WAN
			...Alliance have pledged their
			armies to Count Dooku and are
			forming an... Wait!... ah...
			attack... I don't... make it...
			aaaggghhh!

The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated.

				ANAKIN
			I'm going after him!

				PADME
			I thought the first thing he said
			was to retransmit his message to
			Coruscant.

				ANAKIN
			Yeah, you're right, you're right.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - SUNSET
ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADME. THREEPIO is behind them. ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU.

				MACE WINDU
			We will deal with Count Dooku. The
			most important thing for you,
			Anakin, is to stay where you are.
			Protect the Senator at all costs.
			That is your priority.

				ANAKIN
			Understood, Master.

The hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel.

				PADME
			They'll never get there in time to
			save him. They have to come half
			way across the galaxy. Look,
			Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

PADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him.

				ANAKIN
			If he's still alive.

				PADME
			Annie, are you just going to sit
			here and let him die?? He's your
			friend... your mentor...

				ANAKIN
			...He's like my father, but you
			heard Master Windu. He gave me
			strict orders to stay here.

				PADME
			He gave you strict orders to
			protect me...

PADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.
			So if you plan to protect me, you
			will have to come along.

ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - SUNSET
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order.

INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea.

				MACE WINDU
			The longer we wait, the stronger
			Dooku's armies become. We cannot
			wait for the Senate to make up its
			mind about granting the Chancellor
			emergency powers, in order to be
			able to use that clone army... We
			have the authority to go now. We
			must go now.

All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.

				YODA
			Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred
			Jedi send. Enough, let's hope
			they are.

INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATOES yell furiously at one another.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! Order!!

Finally, the uproar dies.

				PALPATINE
			In the regrettable absence of
			Senator Amidala, the chair
			recognises Senior
			Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
			Binks.

Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his throat.

				JAR JAR
			Senators, dellow felagates...

Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! The Senate will accord the
			Representative the courtesy of a
			hearing!

Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.

				JAR JAR
			In response to the direct threat
			to the Republic from the
			Confederacy of Independent
			Systems, I propose that the Senate
			gives immediate emergency powers to
			the Supreme Chancellor.

Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.

				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			Who can deny these are exceptional
			times? Exceptional times demand
			exceptional measures!
			Exceptional measures demand
			exceptional men!

				ORN FREE TAA
			We won't support a dictator.

SHOUTS of agreement.

				JAR JAR
			That is the sentiment every one of
			us agrees with! And when the
			shadow of war has dispersed and
			the bright day of liberty has
			dawned once again, the power we now
			give to the Supreme Chancellor
			will be gladly, and swiftly
			returned. Out ancient liberties
			will be restored to us, burnished
			even more brightly than before!

Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and bows.

PALPATINE rises.

				PALPATINE
			It is with great reluctance that
			I have agreed to this calling. I
			love democracy... I love the
			Republic. The fact that this
			crisis is demanding I be given
			absolute power to tule over you is
			evident. But I am mild by nature
			and have no desire to destroy
			the democratic process. The power you
			give me I will lay down when this
			crisis has abated, I promise you.
			And all I ask in return is when my
			current term of office is over,
			you allow me to reture and live
			out my life in peace.

				MAS AMEDDA
			We shall proceed to the vote. All
			those in favor of granting
			emergency powers to the Supreme
			Chancellor, signal ate at this
			time... those opposed?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA
The Naboo Starship lands.

INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER - DAY
ANAKIN switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the navigation area of the cockpit. PADME is in the co-pilot's seat. She gets up.

				ANAKIN
			Hey, where are you going?

				PADME
			To find Obi-Wan.

ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.

				ANAKIN
			No! You're not!

He grabs her arm.

				PADME
			Let go of me!

				ANAKIN
			I'm not letting you go out there.
			It's too dangerous.

				PADMÉ
			What?!?

				ANAKIN
			It's my job to protect you. I said
			it's too dangerous. You're not
			going, and that's final!

				PADMÉ
			Don't you give me orders, Annie!
			I'm a Senator of the Galactic
			Republic. You have no authority
			to contain me, restrain me, or
			direct me! You remember your
			place, young man.
				(standing up)
			Now you can come along and protect
			me or stay here. It's up to you.

PADME storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN stands scratching his head, then follows.

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
			Yes, it is, Artoo. Most
			confusing. One moment they're
			generating a pleasant mutual
			attraction and the next, waves of
			violent hostility. Even though
			I'm programmed to understand them,
			I doubt if I ever shall.

ARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh.

INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness.

				PADME
				(in a low voice)
			It's empty!

They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the pillars and detach themselves.

INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his lightsaber.

				PADME
			Wait!

TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them.

The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Senator Amidala, I've heard so
			much about you.

				PADMÉ
			Count Dooku, I assume.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I'm delighted to meet you at
			last. We have a great deal to
			discuss, Senator. I hope you can
			keep your young Jedi under control.

				PADMÉ
			Don't worry he's housebroken.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY
COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far 
side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him.

				PADMÉ
			You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
			Wan Kenobi. I am formally
			requesting you turn him over to
			me, now.

				DOOKU
			He has been convicted of
			espionage, Senator, and will be
			executed. In just a few hours, I
			believe.

COUNT DOOKU smiles.

				PADMÉ
			He is an officer of the Republic.
			You can't do that.

				DOOKU
			We don't recognise the Republic
			here, Senator. But if Naboo were
			to join our Alliance, I could
			easily hear your plea for clemency.

ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.

				PADMÉ
			And if I don't join your
			rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
			me will also die?

				DOOKU
			I don't wish to make you to join
			our cause against your will,
			Senator, but you are a rational,
			honest representative of your
			people and I assume you want to do
			what's in their best interest.
			Aren't you fed up with the
			corruption, the bureaucrats, the
			hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
			you? Be honest, Senator.

				PADMÉ
			The ideals are still alive, Count,
			even if the institution is failing.

				DOOKU
			You believe in the same ideals we
			believe in! The same ideals we
			are striving to make prominent.

				PADMÉ
			If what you say is true, you
			should stay in the Republic and
			help Chancellor Palpatine put
			things right.

				DOOKU
			The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
			but he is incompetent. He has
			promised to cut the bureaucracy,
			but the bureaucrats are stronger
			than ever, no? Senator, the
			Republic cannot be fixed. It is
			time to start over. The
			democratic process in the Republic
			is a sham, a shell game played
			on the voters. It will not be long
			before the cult of greed, called
			the Republic, will lose even the
			pretext of democracy and freedom.

				PADMÉ
			I cannot believe that. I will not
			forsake all I have honoured and
			worked for and betray the
			Republic. I know of your treaties
			with the Trade Federation, the
			Commerce Guilds, and the others,
			Count. What is happening here is
			not government that has been
			bought out by business... it's
			business becoming government!

				DOOKU
			Are you willing to betray your Jedi
			friends? Without your co-operation
			I can do nothing to stop their
			execution.

				PADMÉ
			What is to happen to me? Am I to be
			executed also?

				DOOKU
			I wouldn't think of such an
			offence. But, there are
			individuals who have a strong
			interest in your demise, M'lady.
			It has nothing to do with
			politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
			personal, and they have already
			paid great sums to have you
			assassinated. I'm sure they will
			push hard to have you included in
			the executions. I'm sorry but if
			you are not going to co-operate, I
			must turn you over to the
			Geonosians for justice. I've done
			all I can for you.

JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.

				JANGO FETT
			I'll take that weapon.

ANAKIN hesitates.

				DOOKU 
			You may cause a lot of bloodshed,
			my young Jedi, but you will not
			escape.

				PADMÉ
			Anakin...

ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.

INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.

				SUN RIT
			You have been charged and found
			guilty of Espionage.

				POGGLE
			Do you have anything to say before
			your sentence is carried out?

				PADMÉ
			You are committing an act of war,
			Archduke. I hope you are prepared
			for the consequences.

POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.

				POGGLE
			We build weapons, Senator... that
			is our business! Of course we're
			prepared!

				NUTE GUNRAY
			Get on with it. Carry out the
			sentence. I want to see her suffer.

				POGGLE
			Your other Jedi friend is waiting
			for you, Senator. Take them to
			the arena!

FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.

INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.

The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.

				ANAKIN
			Don't be afraid.

				PADMÉ
			I'm not afraid to die. I've been
			dying a little bit each day since
			you came back into my life.

				ANAKIN
			What are you talking about?

				PADMÉ
			I love you.

				ANAKIN
			You love me?! I thought we
			decided not to fall in love. That
			we would be forced to live a lie.
			That it would destroy our lives...

				PADMÉ
			I think our lives are about to be
			destroyed anyway. My love for you
			is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
			have no answers. I can't control
			it... and now I don't care. I
			truly, deeply love you, and before
			we die I want you to know.

PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for 
their lips to meet. They kiss.

				ANAKIN
			I have no desire to be cured of
			this love either. Long or short,
			I vow to spend the rest of my life
			with you.

They kiss again.

The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena

INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.

				OBI-WAN
			I was beginning to wonder if you
			had gotten my message.

				ANAKIN
			I retransmitted it as you
			requested, Master. Then we decided
			to come and rescue you.

				OBI-WAN
			It looks like you're going a good
			job so far.

Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.

				SUN RIT
			The felons before you have been
			convicted of espionage against the
			Sovereign System of Geonosis.
			Their sentence of death is to be
			carried out in this public arena
			henceforth.

The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.

				POGGLE
			Let the executions begin!

The crowd goes wild.

				ANAKIN
			I have a bad feeling about this.

From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.

The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.

				OBI-WAN
			Take the one the left. I'll
			take the one on the right.

				ANAKIN
			What about Padme?

PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.

				OBI-WAN
			It looks like she's already on top
			of things.

The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post

OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.

The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.

ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.

The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.

In the archducal box:

				NUTE GUNRAY
			Foul!! She can't do that... shoot
			her or something!

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.

				ANAKIN
			You okay?

				PADME
				(nods, gasping)
			Sure! Well, sort of.

				ANAKIN
			Jump!!!

The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.

				NUTE GUNRAY
			This isn't how it's supposed to
			be! Jango, finish her off.

COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(smiling enigmatically)
			Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
			Maybe this is the way it's
			supposed to end.

OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
ARTOO BEEPS

				C-3PO
			Yes, it has been rather a long
			time. Do you suppose something's
			happened to them?

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
				(continuing)
			Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
			so. It looks a very dull planet
			to me. They should be back
			shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu, how pleasant of you
			to join us. You're just in time
			for the moment of truth. I would
			think these two new boys of yours
			could use a little more training.

				MACE WINDU
			Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
			This party's over.

MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(to Mace Windu)
			Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
			friend. You're impossibly
			outnumbered.

				MACE WINDU
			I don't think so. One Jedi has to
			be worth a hundred Geonosians.

COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.

				COUNT DOOKU
			It wasn't the Geonosians I was
			thinking about. How well do you
			think one Jedi will hold up
			against a thousand battle droids?

COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.

MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.

The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.

Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
ARTOO whistles.

				C-3PO
			I don't hear anything.
				(Artoo beeps)
			You're scaring me! Stop imagining
			things!

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.

ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.

MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.

				OBI-WAN
			Someone's got to - shut down -
			these droids.

				MACE WINDU
			Don't worry! It's being - taken
			care of!

EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!

There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.

				PLO KOON
			We've done it! Now we have a
			chance!

Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			The system's off but they're still
			active. That's a new feature. They
			are independent of the control
			system.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.

At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.

KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.

In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu!

Silence.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			You have fought gallantly. Worthy
			of recognition in the history
			archives of the Jedi Order. Now
			it is finished.
				(pauses briefly)
			Surrender - and your lives will be 
			spared.

				MACE WINDU
			We will not be hostages for you to
			barter with Dooku.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
			will have to be destroyed.

The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.

				PADME
			Look!

Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.

				YODA
			Come on - hurry! Hurry!

The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.

EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.

				YODA
			More battalions to the left.
			Encircle them we must, then
			divide.

The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.

				C-3PO
			I'm sure I heard something, this
			time. Didn't you? It's probably
			just a celebration

ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.

The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.

				OBI-WAN
			Hold on! Look over there...

Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			It's Dooku, go after him!

The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Padme!!!

ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing; to pilot)
			Put the ship down! Down!

				OBI-WAN
			No! Forget her. We have to go
			after Dooku.

				ANAKIN
			No we're not!! Land this ship!

				OBI-WAN
			Don't let your personal feelings
			get in the way. We've got a job to
			do.

Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			I don't care!.. Go back.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin! She's all right! Look.

ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Follow that speeder!

On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.

Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.

INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.

				DROID CAPTAIN
			Your Excellency!

COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.

				COUNT DOOKU
			That won't be necessary, Captain.
			Stand down. And leave them to me.

The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.

				OBI-WAN
				(to Anakin)
			We move in together - you slowly
			on the...

				ANAKIN
			I'm taking him now!

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, no!

				ANAKIN
			You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
			killed today, Dooku.

ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN

				COUNT DOOKU
			Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
			my Jedi powers are far beyond
			yours. Now, back down.

				OBI-WAN
			I don't think so.

OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Ah, but if I must.

COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			I have spent the last ten years
			learning to use the power of the
			Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
			greater power.

				OBI-WAN
			You will have to prove it.

OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Grand Master Kenobi, you
			disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
			such high esteem.

COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			Surely you can do better...?
				(parries)
			No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
			swordsmanship degenerated so
			quickly, or are you trying to make
			fun of me?
				(cuts)
			Which is it?

COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
			out of my misery.

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.

COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.

COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			That's brave of you, boy - but
			foolish. I would have thought
			you'd have learnt your lesson.

				ANAKIN
			I'm a slow learner.

And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.

				COUNT DOOKU
			You have unusual powers, young
			Padawan. But not enought to save
			you this time.

				ANAKIN
			Don't bet on it!

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!

OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.

Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.

Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.

Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Yoda. At last we shall
			know who is the most powerful.

YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.

				YODA
			Count Dooku. No interest in
			contests, do I have.

COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.

YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.

Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			The end for you, Count, this is.

				COUNT DOOKU
			...Not yet...

COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.

ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.

YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.

				PADMÉ
			Anakin!

PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.

				CLONE CAPTAIN
			Resistance is at an end, General.
			What are your orders ?

YODA looks at him and sighs.

EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.

INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.

				COUNT DOOKU
			The Force is with us, my Master.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
			done well.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I bring you good news, my Lord.
			The war has begun.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Excellent. 
			 	(smiling)
			Everything is going as planned.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - SUNSET
The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET

				MACE WINDU
			Where is your apprentice?

				OBI-WAN
			On his way back to Naboo. He is
			escorting Senator Amidala home.

They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			I must admit without the clones,
			it would not have been a victory.

				YODA
			Victory? Victory, you say?

OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			Not victory, a defeat, it was...
			Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
			War has!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.

EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.

On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.

The Great Clone War has begun...

FADE OUT:

STAR WARS EPISODE 3: REVENGE OF THE SITH SCRIPT

George Lucas


1 EXT. SPACE

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.

War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.

In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate.

As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . .

PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.

2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.

3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.

ANAKIN: There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .

OBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . .

4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE

The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.

5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.

OBI-WAN: We've got to split them up.

ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.

OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.

OBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?

ANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.

OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me!

ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .

ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.

ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!

ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.

ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo.

OBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck.

ANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.

OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!

ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.

OBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don't like this!

OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch!

R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.

ANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him . . .

ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.

OBI-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...

R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.

ANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.

ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.

ANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.

6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.

ANAKIN: Come on, Master.

OBI-WAN: Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?

ODD BALL: (OS) Copy, Red Leader.

OBI-WAN: Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .

7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ODD BALL: We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.

The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.

8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.

ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.

OBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .

ANAKIN: I'm going head to head. See you.

OBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin.

Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.

ODD BALL: I'm on your right, Red Leader.

ANAKIN: Incoming!!

ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.

OBI-WAN: Five more on the right!

Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.

ANAKIN: Here we go.

The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.

OBI-WAN: I'm going high and right.

ANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.

OBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.

ANAKIN: I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.

OBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.

In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.

ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.

ANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail.

ANAKIN: I know. I know!

OBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left.

ANAKIN: I know. I know!

OBI-WAN: Break right and go high.

ANAKIN: I'm going low and left.

Obi-Wan shakes his head.

OBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.

ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.

ANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .

OBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."

ANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.

OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.

OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.

ARTOO BEEPS nervously.

ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.

OBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.

ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."

ANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.

ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through.

OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION.
A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.
Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.

ODD BALL: There are too many of them.

CLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .

ANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out!

OBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!

Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.

ANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up!

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.

OBI-WAN: They overshot us . . .

The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan’s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.

ANAKIN: They're coming around!

OBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

ANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.

ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.

ANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo!

Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.

OBI-WAN: Flying is for droids.

Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?

ANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.

The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .

ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.

OBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.

ANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.

OBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.

ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan’s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ...

ANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . .

OBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.

ANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .

OBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.

ANAKIN: Move to the right.

OBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.

ANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master.

ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view.

ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.

OBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.

ANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!

OBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.

ANAKIN: Yeah, you got him!

OBI-WAN: Great, Artoo.

ANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.

OBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up?

ANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.

OBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.

9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.

ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.
OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.

ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.

ANAKIN: Tap into the ship's computers.

They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.

OBI-WAN: The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.

ANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . .

OBI-WAN: I sense a trap.

ANAKIN: Next move?

OBI-WAN: Spring the trap.

The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.

ANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.

OBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders.

OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.

10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: What's the situation, Captain?

CAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted.

11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.

BODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.

OBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.

As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.

OBI-WAN: Anakin. . .

ANAKIN: Ready.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.

12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.

OBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.

ANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being.

OBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.

They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.

ANAKIN: They're sealing this section off.

OBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way!

The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.

ANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.

They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.

OBI-WAN: We'll never get through that. It's too small!

They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.

The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.

ANAKIN: I found our escape vent.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.

ANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .

ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.

13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.

ANAKIN: Here's a way out.

As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.

14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.

15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.

OBI-WAN: That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.

ANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.

OBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin.

16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.

SUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.

17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.

18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE

A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser.

19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.

OBI-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!

ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.

20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.

ANAKIN: Destroyers!!

Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.

BATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.

The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.

21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

R2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.

22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.

OBI-WAN: Did you press the stop button?

ANAKIN: No, did you?

OBI-WAN: No!

ANAKIN: Well, there's more than one way out of here.

ANAKIN ignites his laser sword.

OBI-WAN: We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . .

ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.

23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: What's that?

SUPER BATTLE DROID 2: Get back to work. It's nothing.

24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN: Artoo?

ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move.

OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.

25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.

OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.

26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.

27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator starts to descend rapidly.

OBI-WAN: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.

28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.

DROID 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.

DROID 2: Roger, roger.

29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN's comlink messages to ARTOO.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: There it is again.

OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.

30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.

OBI-WAN: Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!

The elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.

31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: Hey you!

ARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.

32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.

OBI-WAN: Now, that's better . . .

33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: You stupid little astro droid!

34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.

Before ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN: Oh, it's you . . .

35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.

36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN: What was that all about?

OBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . .

ANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.

OBI-WAN: Did I say anything?

ANAKIN: He's trying!

OBI-WAN: I didn't say anything!

37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.

38 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters.
At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.
As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face.

OBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor.

ANAKIN: Are you all right?

PALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku.

PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.

OBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.

ANAKIN: I was about to say that.

COUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.

PALPATINE: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.

OBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.

COUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.

OBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.

COUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this.

ANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.

COUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

DOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .

COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.

As the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.
ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking.
ANAKIN hits the archway.
DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.

COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don’t use them.

Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.
Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.

39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat.

PALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!

ANAKIN: I shouldn't . . .

PALPATINE: Do it!!

ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.

ANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself.

PALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

ANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

ANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.

PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.

PALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.

The ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.

ANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.

PALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it.

ANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.

ANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.

40 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare for attack.

PILOT: All batteries fire! Fire!

41 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER

Clone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying.

42 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him.

ANAKIN: The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . .

ARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.

Suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!

43 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Windows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space.

PILOT: Reverse stabilizers.

44 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of the ship to the other.
Several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.

45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.
ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.

46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror.

47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

PILOT: Magnetize! Magnetize!

48 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him.

49 EXT. SPACE-CORUSCANT

The TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER heads straight down toward the planet.

50 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder.

ANAKIN: We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.

PALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.

51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Fire the emergency booster engines.

PILOT: Leveling out, sir.

52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.

53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.

ANAKIN: Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.

OBI-WAN: Did I miss something?

OBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.

ANAKINN: Hold on.

OBI-WAN: What is that?

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops.

ANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!

OBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!

They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.

54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.

OBI-WAN: Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.

ANAKIN: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?

55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.

56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.

57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.

OBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.

ANAKIN: I agree.

PALPATINE: What are we going to do?

ANAKIN: I don't know.

OBI-WAN: Don't look at me. I don't know.

ANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.

ANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.

OBI-WAN: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.

ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.

58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.

59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath.

ANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close.

They laugh.

60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

BODYGUARD: General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Activate ray shields.

61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.

ANAKIN: Ray shields!

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.

OBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.

ANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.

OBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.

ANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero.

OBI-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here.

PALPATINE: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.

The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.

ANAKIN: I say . . . patience.

OBI-WAN: Patience! That's your plan, is it?

ANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .

ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.

ANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.

Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.
ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.

SUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.

OBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B?

62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.

A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S lightsabers.

OBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.

ANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .

OBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.

OBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won't escape.

ANAKIN: Artoo.

ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.
OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!

ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand.

The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's TWO BODYGUARDS.

CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.

OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.
OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.
ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.
OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.
ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

PILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.

One of the PILOTS stands next to the General.

PILOT: The ship is breaking up!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: We've run out of time.

OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.

63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.

PALPATINE: The hull is burning up!

64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized hands and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.

65 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch. The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Time to abandon ship.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the escape pods are jettisoned.

66 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE

He gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged Cruiser.

67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator's chair.

ANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.

OBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

ANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?

ANAKIN sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.

OBI-WAN: Well?

ANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.

OBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine 's controls and assists in flying the cruiser.

OBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN: Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.

OBI-WAN: Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .

A large part of the ship breaks away.

ANAKIN: We lost something.

OBI-WAN: Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.

ANAKIN: Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.

OBI-WAN: Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .

ANAKIN: What's our speed?

OBI-WAN: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .

ANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.

ANAKIN: Grab that . . . Keep us level.

OBI-WAN: Steady. Steady.

ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.

OBI-WAN: Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.

FlRESHIP PILOT: We'll take you in.

OBI-WAN: Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.

ANAKIN: We're coming in too hot.

OBI-WAN: Easy-easy.

The ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.

68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM-AFTERNOON

A large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.

OBI-WAN: Another happy landing.

69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON

The small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.

ANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?

OBI-WAN: Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.

ANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.

OBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .

ANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.

OBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.

ANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .

OBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.

ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.
The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.

MACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?

PALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.

MACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.

PALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

MACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.

BAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.

BAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.

ANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.

ANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.

ARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.

C-3PO: It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

ARTOO beeps.

C-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.

BAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.

ANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.

Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.

BAIL ORGANA: I'll do everything I can with the Senate.

ANAKIN: Excuse me.

BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.

ANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.

PADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.

ANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.

PADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.

ANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.

ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.

PADME: Wait, not here . . .

He grabs her again.

ANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.

PADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .

ANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.

PADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.

ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.

ANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?

PADME: I'm just excited to see you.

ANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?

PADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .

ANAKIN: You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!

PADME begins to cry.

PADME: You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .

ANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?

PADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.

ANAKIN: (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.

PADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.

ANAKIN: It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .

PADME: Something wonderful has happened.

They look at each other for a long moment.

PADME: (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.

ANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.

ANAKIN: That's . . . that's wonderful.

PADME: What are we going to do?

ANAKIN: We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.

71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Good. Where is the Separatist Council?

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: This way, sir ...

GENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.

72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

A hologram of Darth Sidious appears.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Yes, Lord Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS: General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It will be done, My Lord.

DARTH SlDIOUS: The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.

The hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of Count Dooku.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: But the loss of Count Dooku?

DARTH SlDIOUS: His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.

73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT

PADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.

ANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.

PADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.

ANAKIN: You are so beautiful!

PADME: It's only because I'm so in love . . .

ANAKIN: No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

PADME: So love has blinded you?

ANAKIN: Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .

PADME: But it's probably true!

They laugh.

ANAKIN: I haven't laughed in so long . . .

PADME: Neither have I.

74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

The view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming.

PADME: Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.

She screams and dies.

75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT

ANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.

PADME: Anakin??

She gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.

76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT

ANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught.
PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.

PADME: What's bothering you?

ANAKIN: Nothing . . .

ANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.

PADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?

ANAKIN: It was a dream.

PADME: Bad?

ANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.

PADME: And?

ANAKIN: It was about you.

They look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.

PADME: Tell me.

ANAKIN: It was only a dream.

PADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath.

ANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . .

PADME: And the baby?

ANAKIN: I don't know.

PADME: It was only a dream.

ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.

ANAKIN: . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.

They embrace, then part.

PADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.

ANAKIN: I know ….

PADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?

ANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything?

PADME: No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.

ANAKIN: He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!

PADME: I won't, Anakin.

ANAKIN: I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.

77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY

YODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda 's room, deep in thought.

YODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .

ANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . .

YODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

ANAKIN: Someone . . .

YODA: . . . close to you?

ANAKIN: Yes.

YODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

ANAKIN: I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.

YODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.

ANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda?

YODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.

78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY

ANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.

79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.

OBI-WAN: You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.

ANAKIN: I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.

OBI-WAN: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

ANAKIN: What's wrong then?

OBI-WAN: The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.

ANAKIN: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.

ANAKIN: Be careful of what?

OBI-WAN: He has requested your presence.

ANAKIN: What for?

OBI-WAN: He would not say.

ANAKIN: He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?

OBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.

ANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?

OBI-WAN: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.

80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY

ANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over the landscape.

PALPATINE: Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.

ANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?

PALPATINE: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.

ANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.

PALPATINE: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.

ANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.

PALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.

ANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.

PALPATINE: Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.

ANAKIN: Of course.

PALPATINE: I need your help, son.

ANAKIN: What do you mean?

PALPATINE: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.

ANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.

PALPATINE: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.

ANAKIN: For what? I don't understand.

PALPATINE: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .

ANAKIN thinks about this.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.

ANAKIN: Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.

PALPATINE: I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.

81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S OFFICE-DAY

PADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa 's office.

BAIL ORGANA: Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.

FANG ZAR: When did this happen?

BAIL ORGANA: The decree was posted this morning.

PADME: Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?

MON MOTHMA: Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.

GIDDEAN DANU: The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.

BAIL ORGANA: We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.

EVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said.

TERR TANEEL: What are you suggesting?

BAIL ORGANA: I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.

MON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.

BAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.

PADME: I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.

GlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.

MON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.

BAIL ORGANA: We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .

PADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.

BAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.

MON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.

They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.

PADME: Agreed.

82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens.

83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI.

MACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.

ANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.

YODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.

ANAKIN: I understand.

MACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.

Anakin reacts with anger.

ANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?

MACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker.

ANAKIN: Forgive me, Master.

ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.

YODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.

OBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.

MACE: We cannot take ships from the front line.

OBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.

YODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

MACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!

OBI-WAN: He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.

ANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.

MACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.

YODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.

MACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.

ANAKIN is disappointed.

84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.

ANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!

OBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

ANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .

OBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.

ANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.

ANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.

OBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.

ANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.

OBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.

ANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.

OBI-WAN: I hope so . . .

ANAKIN: I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.

ANAKIN: And?

OBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.

ANAKIN: What situation?

OBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.

ANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!

OBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.

ANAKIN: Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?

OBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.

ANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.

OBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.

ANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.

OBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.

ANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?

OBI-WAN: The Council is asking you.

85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.

86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY

YODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.

OBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.

YODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.

MACE: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.

OBI-WAN: He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.

MACE:I wish I did.

OBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?

MACE: So the prophecy says.

YODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.

OBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has.

YODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.

The GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.

87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET

Padme's Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.

PADME: Thank you, Captain.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady.

CAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.

PADME: I'll be up in a while.

MOTEE: Yes, my lady.

C-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.

C-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?

PADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.

The golden droid turns and exits.

PADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something.

ANAKIN: Beautiful, isn't it?

PADME jumps and turns around.

PADME: You startled me.

He sits next to her on the bench.

ANAKIN: How are you feeling?

PADME: He keeps kicking.

ANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it's a boy?

PADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition.

She puts his hand on her belly.

ANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.

They laugh.

PADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.

ANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.

PADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.

ANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.

PADME: Anakin . . .

ANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.

PADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?

ANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean?

PADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?

ANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!

PADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.

ANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!

PADME: What is it?

ANAKIN: Nothing.

PADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.

ANAKIN: You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.

They look in each other's eyes.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.

PADME is startled at this.

PADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me.

PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.

PADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.

88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT

ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.
ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.
ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing "Squid Lake."

ANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.

PALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.

ANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.

PALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far … but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.

ANAKIN: They try.

PALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.

ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.

ANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand.

PALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.

ANAKIN: I don't think . . .

PALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?

ANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . .

PALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.

ANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.

PALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

ANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.

PALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

ANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say.

PALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.

ANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.

PALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .

ANAKIN: . . . evil.

PALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.

ANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.

PALPATINE: And the Jedi don't?

ANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.

PALPATINE smiles.

PALPATINE: Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?

ANAKIN: I'm not sure it's wrong.

PALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.

ANAKIN is deep in thought.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?

ANAKIN: No.

PALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

ANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?

PALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

ANAKIN: What happened to him?

PALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

ANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?

PALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.

89 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY

A WOOKIEE CATAMARAN flanked by WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS approaches the tree housing the HOLOGRAM AREA.

90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.

MACE: (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.

ANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.

YODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

OBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?

All the JEDI concur.

ANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.

They all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.

MACE: (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.

YODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.

MACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.

ANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.

OBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.

ANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.

OBI-WAN: Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.

YODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

YODA: I agree.

All the JEDI concur.

MACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.

ANAKIN is angry.

MACE: (continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.

91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: The droids have started up their main power generators.

YODA: Then now the time is, Commander.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, sir.

The battle begins.

92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY

A WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle.

93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING

Padme's apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant.

94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING

PADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.

OBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you?

PADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.

OBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.

They laugh.

PADME: You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?

OBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.

PADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings.

OBI-WAN: It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.

PADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?

OBI-WAN studies her.

OBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.

PADME: Don't give me that look.

OBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you.

PADME: (nervous) What did he say?

OBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn't have to.

PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.

PADME: I don't know what you're talking about.

OBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him.

PADME looks down and doesn't answer.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .

They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .

PADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan.

OBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him.

95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY

PADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme's living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.

PADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.

BAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.

MON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.

PADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.

BANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.

MON MOTHMA: We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.

PADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.

GiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.

PADME: The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .

CHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator.

FANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.

BANA BREEMU: When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.

BAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.

PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.

96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.

ANAKIN: You're going to need me on this one, Master.

OBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.

OBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.

ANAKIN: Master!

OBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.

OBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.

OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.

ANAKIN: Well, there's always a first time.

OBI-WAN laughs.

They talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser.

97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.

98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE

CLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.

OBI-WAN: I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?

They laugh.

OBI-WAN: (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.

OBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe.

OBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: I'm counting on you.

99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE

OBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau.

100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY

The Chancellor's Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him.

PALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?

ANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous's head.

PALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.

ANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision.

They exit the landing platform.

101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY

They enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.

JAR JAR: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .

The Gungan waves to Anakin.

ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.

Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.

PALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.

ANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?

PALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.

ANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!?

PALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.

ANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know.

PALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.

ANAKIN becomes worried.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.

102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

PADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.

OBI-WAN: Save your energy.

PADME: I can't!

OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .

103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.

ANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

PADME: He came by this morning.

ANAKIN: What did he want?

PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.

PADME: He's worried about you.

ANAKIN: You told him about us, didn't you?

She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.

PADME: He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.

ANAKIN: And he's not?

PADME: You have been moody lately.

ANAKIN: I'm not moody . . .

PADME: Anakin! Don't do this again.

ANAKIN: I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.

PADME: Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.

PADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.

ANAKIN: Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.

PADME: You expect too much of yourself.

They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.

ANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.

PADME: Save me?

ANAKIN: From my nightmares.

PADME: Is that what's bothering you?

ANAKIN: I won't lose you, Padme.

PADME: I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.

ANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.

PADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.

PADME: You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.

They embrace and kiss.

104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE

OBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.

105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.

TlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

OBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war.

TlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.

OBI-WAN: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.

A GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan’s Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.

TlON MEDON: He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.

OBI-WAN: I understand.

TlON MEDON: The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .

OBI-WAN: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.

OBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.

The little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.

106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY

On a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.

TlON MEDON: I told you, all he wanted was fuel.

BODYGUARD: What was his name?

TlON MEDON: He didn't say.

They watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.

107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY

OBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.

108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY

OBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It's hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.

109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.
He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.
OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements.

OBI-WAN: I need transportation.

WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.

OBI-WAN: Get it for me.

WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.

One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.

OBI-WAN: This one.

The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.

WRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga.

OBI-WAN: Good girl, Boga.

OBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.

110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY

The LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.

111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.

NUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.

OBI-WAN is deep in thought.

112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

The JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.

OBI-WAN: Hello, there!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!

About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
They stare at each other for a moment.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this.

The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury.
OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

OBI-WAN: Your move.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.

His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.

OBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!

OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.

OBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.

OBI-WAN: I don't think so.

TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.

113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.
The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.

114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga.

115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET

The sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red.

116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET

PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.

PALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.

PADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?

PALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .

PADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.

PALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.

FANGZAR: But surely . . .

The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.

PALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.

PADME: On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.

PALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.

PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.

ANAKIN: What do you mean?

PALPATINE: They are not to be trusted.

ANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .

PALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.

ANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken.

PALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.

ANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.

PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.

PALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.

117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING

KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we
have begun our attack.

MACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
intentions.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears.

MACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from
office.

MACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.

YODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.

118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

ANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.

PALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.

ANAKIN: I should be there with him.

PALPATINE: It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?

ANAKIN: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.

PALPATINE: They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.

They walk into the hallway.

ANAKIN: How do you know the ways of the Force?

PALPATINE: My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.

They stop.

ANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?

PALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.

ANAKIN: I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.

PALPATINE: Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.

ANAKIN: What did you say?

PALPATINE: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .

ANAKIN: You're a Sith Lord!

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.

PALPATINE: I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.

ANAKIN: You're wrong!

PALPATINE: Are you going to kill me?

ANAKIN: I would certainly like to.

PALPATINE: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.

ANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE's throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.

ANAKIN: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.

PALPATINE: Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?

ANAKIN: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.

PALPATINE: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.

ANAKIN stares at him for a moment.
PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.

PALPATINE: (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .

PALPATINE sits behind his desk.

119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.

120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY

A LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the DROID ARMY.

OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan's LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.

121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan's access to the General. Obi-Wan's LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.

OBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

The GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan's LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.

122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid's electronic staff.

123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

Extending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.

OBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General's scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General's electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.

OBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS's stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the Droid's chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid's laser pistol.

The JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.

OBI-WAN: So uncivilized . . .

OBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.

124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

MACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR's office. ANAKIN enters the hangar.

ANAKIN: Master Windu, I must talk to you.

MACE WiNDU: What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.

ANAKIN: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.

MACE WINDU: A Sith Lord?

ANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for.

MACE WiNDU: How do you know this?

ANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.

MACE WiNDU: Are you sure?

ANAKIN: Absolutely.

MACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.

ANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.

MACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.

ANAKIN: I must go, Master.

MACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

MACE WiNDU: Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

ANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship.

125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING

(INTERCUT)

PADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.

PALPATINE: (V.O.) You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.

PADME: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.

C-3PO: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?

ANAKIN: I can't do this ... I can't let her die.

ANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off.

126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

The sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform.
FOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across.

127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

The FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor's aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor's office.

128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.

PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.

MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.

MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.

PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

MACE: The Senate will decide your fate.

PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!

MACE: Not yet!

PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.

PALPATINE: It's treason, then.

A close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight.

Jedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.

ANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor's office.

In the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor's desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.

They stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.

MACE WINDU: You are under arrest, My Lord.

PALPATINE: Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.

MACE WlNDU: You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .

PALPATINE: No! No! You will die!

PALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by MACE's lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.

PALPATINE: He is a traitor, Anakin.

MACE WlNDU: He's the traitor. Stop him!

PALPATINE: Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.

MACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .

PALPATINE: You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.

MACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .

PALPATINE: I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.

MACE WlNDU: Don't listen to him, Anakin.

PALPATINE: Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .

MACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine's hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.

PALPATINE: I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.

MACE WlNDU: You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.

ANAKIN: You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.

MACE WlNDU: He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.

PALPATINE: I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.

ANAKIN: It is not the Jedi way . . .

MACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.

ANAKIN: (continuing) He must live . . .

PALPATINE: Please don't, please don't . . .

ANAKIN: I need him . . .

PALPATINE: Please don't . . .

ANAKIN: NO!!!

Just as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and cuts off the Jedi's hand holding the lightsaber.

As MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life.
The full force of Palpatine's powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.

PALPATINE: Power! Unlimited power!

His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.

ANAKIN: What have I done?

ANAKIN sits.

PALPATINE: You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

ANAKIN: I will do whatever you ask.

PALPATINE: Good.

ANAKIN: Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.

PALPATINE: To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.

ANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.

PALPATINE: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.

ANAKIN: Thank you. my Master.

PALPATINE: Rise, Darth Vader.

Palpatine moves over to his desk.

129 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY

YODA winces, closes his eyes, and holds his head. He feels a disturbance in the Force.

130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING

PALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak: he is now fully DARTH SIDIOUS.

PALPATINE: Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.

ANAKIN: I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.

PALPATINE: Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?

ANAKIN: I understand, Master.

PALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.

ANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?

PALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.

131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT

ANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers.

132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY

The battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY.

OBI-WAN: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Very good, sir.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.

He hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up.

OBI-WAN: Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Yes, sir!

OBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.
The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: It will be done, My Lord.

The HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Blast him!

The battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him.
OBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole.

133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN

The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . .

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir.

DARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He's killed before he can defend himself.

134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY

A column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush.

AAYLA: Steady. . . . steady . . .

They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi.

AAYLA: (continuing) Bly, do you think they're Droids?

BLY: No.

BLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground.

141 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS stands alone in his private office, illuminated only from a hologram projector beam from above. A small HOLOGRAM OF COMMANDER GREE stands in front of him.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, My Lord.

DABTH SIDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

142 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY

A vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tank-like vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: It will be done, My Lord.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut.

YODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal their weapons and fire.

But faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them. CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away.

143 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT

A JEDI is surrounded and gunned down by CLONE TROOPERS.

144 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT

He exits Shaak Ti's room and enters a hallway, where the battle is taking place.

145 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BATTLE-NIGHT

ANAKIN enters a room full of YOUNGLINGS huddled in a corner.

YOUNGLINGS: Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?

ANAKIN looks back at them with a stern expression on his face and ignites his lightsaber.

146 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

C-3PO and PADME look out the apartment window.

C-3PO: The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.

PADME bursts into tears.

147 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN

The city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA's Speeder flies overhead, straight toward the smoke.

148 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PRE-DAWN

The Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform. FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and walks toward them.

BAIL ORGANA: What's going on here?!?

CLONE SERGEANT: There's been a rebellion. Don't worry, sir, the situation is under control.

The CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple.

CLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.

The CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them.

CLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) It's time for you to leave, sir.

BAIL ORGANA: And so it is.

BAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (1119), who points at BAIL.

CLONE COMMANDER APPO: Get him! Shoot him!

SEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser
pistol.

The YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO, before he is overrun and shot.

The Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape.

149 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN

BAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races away.

150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY

The Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing.

151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY

OBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.

OBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBI-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.

The NOS MONSTER'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water.

The SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel system.

152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK

CLONES in modified one-man AT-ST's and Swamp Speeders flash their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT-ST's spots something floating in the water. It is what's left of a Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.

AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there!

A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.

CREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)

CLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something?

CREATURE: It's nothing, nothing. (laughs)

CLONE SERGEANT: It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.

CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.

Suddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS.

CREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.

TARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda.

YODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.

YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.

YODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .

YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp.

153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK

The AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches.
The ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod.

YODA: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.

The Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into the dusk sky.

154 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND STARSHIP LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

BAIL ORGANA walks out of a tunnel onto a huge underground platform with two of his AIDES. He is stopped by TWO ROYAL GUARDS.

ROYAL GUARD: Identification . . .

BAIL ORGANA: Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.

BAIL and his AIDES hand them their ID cards. The ROYAL GUARDS check them over and give them back, then BAIL and his CREW walk on board his Starship.

155 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The platform rises to the surface of the Office Building. The ALDERAAN STARCRUISER takes off and disappears into the crisp morning sky.

156 INT ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY

BAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS.

BAIL ORGANA: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?

CAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.

BAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.

157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS.

CLONE CAPTAIN: Did you find Kenobi?

CLONE TROOPER: No one could have survived that fall.

He watches them pass.

CLONE CAPTAIN: Start loading your men on the ship.

CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.

OBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs.

158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous's secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky.

159 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE

OBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous's tiny Starfighter.

160 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S STARFIGHTER-SPACE

OBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his comlink.

OBI-WAN: Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .

A BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears.

BAIL: (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I've locked on. Repeat.

The FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA.

BAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi??

OBI-WAN: Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.

BAIL ORGANA: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.

161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

PADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the bedroom.

C-3PO: My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.

PADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.

162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN

THREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN's ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps.

THREEPIO: Hush! Not so loud!

PADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace.

PADME: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.

ANAKIN: I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

PADME: Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?

C-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.

C-3PO: What is going on?

ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.

C-3PO: (continuing) You can't be anymore confused than I am.

ANAKIN: The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .

PADME: I can't believe that!

ANAKIN: I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.

C-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.

C-3PO: Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.

ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.

C-3PO: (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.

ARTOO BEEPS quietly.

C-3PO: (continuing) Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.

PADME: Anakin, what are you going to do?

ANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.

ANAKIN: I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.

ANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.

PADME: What about Obi-Wan?

ANAKIN: I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.

PADME: How could this have happened?

ANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.

PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.

PADME: What are you saying?

ANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.

PADME: What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?

ANAKIN: That won't happen. I won't let it.

PADME: Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.

ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.

ANAKIN: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.

They kiss.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Please, wait for me.

PADME: I will.

ANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.

C-3PO: (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.

ARTOO beeps.

C-3PO: (continuing) Take care, my little friend.

ARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.

C-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?

PADME: No thank you, Threepio.

G-3PO: A snack, perhaps?

PADME: No.

THREEPIO starts to move off.

C-3PO: I feel so helpless.

163 EXT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-SPACE

OBI-WAN's ship docks with Bail Organa's Starcruiser.

164 INT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY

The door to the main hallway slides open. OBI-WAN enters and is greeted by YODA and BAIL ORGANA. The three walk down the hallway.

BAIL ORGANA: You made it.

YODA: Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.

OBI-WAN: You were attacked by your Clones, also?

YODA: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.

OBI-WAN: How many other Jedi managed to survive?

YODA: Heard from no one, have we.

BAIL ORGANA: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.

OBI-WAN: Have we had any contact from the Temple?

YODA: Received a coded retreat message, we have.

BAIL ORGANA: It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .

OBI-WAN: Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.

BAIL ORGANA: It's too dangerous to return.

YODA: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?

OBI-WAN: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.

YODA: I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.

165 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY

Workers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward.

166 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

A HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room. NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION watch SIDIOUS.

NUTE GUNRAY: The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS: You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.

The hologram disappears.

167 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT

The Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant. OBI-WAN, BAIL, YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit.

PILOT: We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.

BAIL ORGANA: Send it through.

PILOT: Yes, sir.

The PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen.

MAS AMEDDA: Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.

BAIL ORGANA: Tell the Chancellor I will be there.

MAS AMEDDA: Very well. He will be expecting you.

MAS AMEDDA's image disappears from the screen.

BAIL ORGANA: It could be a trap.

OBI-WAN: No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.

YODA: If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.

168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out.

GUARD: Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?

BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.

GUARD: Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.

OBI-WAN: It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.

GUARD: It would be better if they stayed with you.

BAIL and his AIDES go into the Senate. YODA and OBI-WAN head for the Jedi Temple.

169 EXT. MUSTAFAR-JEDI STARFIGHTER-SPACE

ANAKIN's Jedi Starfighter heads for the hazy blood-red planet of Mustafar.

170 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN flies over the volcanoes of Mustafar and lands his Jedi Starfighter on a complex of Landing Platforms. His cockpit opens as R2-D2 pops from the ship with a happy BEEP.

ANAKIN: Artoo . . . stay with the ship.

ARTOO lets out a sad little BEEP and moves back toward the ship.

171 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN, putting on his hood, walks across a walkway upon arriving on Mustafar.

172 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN appears in the doorway of the control center.

NUTE GUNRAY: Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.

Everyone in the room looks to him as he raises his hand toward a control panel, and all the exits close. The confused SEPARATISTS look around in bewilderment.

173 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LATE DAY

Smoke from the smoldering shell of the Jedi Temple fills the air with a brown haze.

174 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MAIN ENTRANCE-LATE DAY

A DOZEN CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance of the Jedi Temple. Suddenly there is a flash of a lightsaber, a flurry of confusion, and all of the Clone Troopers are dead on the floor. YODA and OBI-WAN stand in the middle of the carnage.

OBI-WAN: There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.

YODA: Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.

175 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE BUILDING-SUNSET

The awesome Senate Building looms over the city. The endless traffic continues to clutter the skyline.

176 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

The Chancellor is in the podium in the center of the vast arena giving a speech. MAS AMEDDA stands to the right of SIDIOUS. BAIL ORGANA walks through the hallway of the Main Senate Chamber. He enters the Senate Pod of Naboo and sits next to PADME. JAR JAR, CAPTAIN TYPHO and TWO HANDMAIDENS are in the pod also.

PALPATINE: . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.

BAIL ORGANA: I was held up. What's happening?

PADME: The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.

BAIL ORGANA: That's not true!

PADME: He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.

BAIL ORGANA: And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do.

PALPATINE: The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. (applause) Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.

(applause)

These have been trying times, but we have passed the test.

177 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-SUNSET

YODA and OBI-WAN make their way through the Temple, avoiding the HUNDREDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. They use the Force to distract the CLONES when they can.
YODA and OBI-WAN walk through the ruins of the Temple until they come across the bodies of some students.

OBI-WAN: Not even the younglings survived.

YODA: Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.

OBI-WAN: . . .Who?? Who could have done this?

178 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The DROIDS at the controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it is too late. They are cut down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO flee under a table.

ANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper. Bodies drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the Banking Clan dies.

Then POGGLE THE LESSER loses his head; WAT TAMBOR, SHU MAI, and the REST OF THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference room.

179 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

PALPATINE: The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.

Applause.

180 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

In the hallway, ANAKIN cuts down DROIDS and SEPARATISTS alike. He is unstoppable. ANAKIN turns his head-his eyes are yellow.

181 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

PALPATINE continues his speech at the podium.

PALPATINE: The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.

There is a long period of APPLAUSE.

PADME: Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.

PALPATINE: In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.

There is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded.

PALPATINE: (continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .

The Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated. PADME begins to cry.

PALPATINE: (continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .

The Senate APPLAUDS.

PADME: So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .

BAIL ORGANA: We cannot let this happen.

He starts to stand up. PADME stops him.

PADME: Not now! There will be a time.

182 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY

After everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances.

RUNE HAAKO: Stop! Enough, this is not right!

RUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them.

183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY

NUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.

NUTE GUNRAY: The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want . . .

NUTE GUNRAY is cut down in midsentence.

184 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT

OBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center.

OBI-WAN: I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

YODA: Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.

185 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT

OBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area.

OBI-WAN: Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .

YODA: If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.

OBI-WAN: I must know the truth, Master.

OBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) It can't be . . . It can't be . . .

As ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him.

ANAKIN: The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?

ANAKIN: Yes, My Master.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.

OBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes.

OBI-WAN: I can't watch any more.

OBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments.

YODA: Destroy the Sith, we must.

OBI-WAN: Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.

YODA: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.

OBI-WAN: He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.

YODA: Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.

OBI-WAN: How could it have come to this?

YODA: To question, no time there is.

OBI-WAN: I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.

YODA: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN: May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.

186 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-AFTERNOON

A DC0052 Intergalactic Speeder pulls up to the veranda landing of Padme's apartment.

187 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-AFTERNOON

The cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE.

C-3PO: Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.

The security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding.

OBI-WAN: Has Anakin been here . . . ?

C-3PO: Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.

PADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves.

PADME: Master Kenobi . . .

She embraces Obi-Wan.

PADME: (continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.

OBI-WAN: The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .

PADME: I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.

OBI-WAN: I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.

PADME: The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.

OBI-WAN: No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.

PADME: The Sith!?!

OBI-WAN: I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?

PADME: Yesterday.

OBI-WAN: And do you know where he is now?

PADME: (looks down) No.

OBI-WAN: Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.

PADME: From the Sith?

OBI-WAN: From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.

PADME: You're wrong! How could you even say that?

OBI-WAN: I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.

PADME: Not Anakin! He couldn't!

OBI-WAN: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.

PADME: I don't believe you ... I can't.

OBI-WAN: Padme, I must find him.

PADME: You're going to kill him, aren't you?

OBI-WAN: He has become a very great threat.

As PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy.

PADME: I can't . . .

OBI-WAN: Anakin is the father, isn't he?

PADME looks away.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm so sorry.

OBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing what to do. She is worried and tormented. OBI-WAN takes off in the Speeder. She studies the japor snippet that is hanging around her neck.

188 INT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

R2-D2 waits forlornly for his Master in front of the Jedi Starfighter.

189 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

190 INT. MUSTAFAR-CONTROL CENTER-BALCONY-DAY

ANAKIN stares out at Mustafar, standing on the control room balcony.

191 EXT. CORUSCANT-LANDING PLATFORM-SUNSET

A small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-3PO.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: My Lady, let me come with you.

PADME: There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.

TYPHO bows.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.

PADME: I'll be all right, Captain.

He goes to the speeder and gets in.

PADME: (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.

C-3PO: Oh, dear.

TYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off.

192 INT. NABOO SKIFF

THREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in.

C-3PO: Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.

OBI-WAN stows away on Padme's ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes.

193 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-SUNSET

A HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office at the bottom of the Senate Arena.

DARTH VADER: The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.

DARTH SlDIOUS: It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.

DARTH VADER: Thank you, My Master.

194 INT. MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY

A Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.

DARTH VADER: Very good, My Lord.

ANAKIN sees Padme's ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her.

195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin's GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.

ANAKIN: Padme, I saw your ship . . .

They embrace.

PADME: Oh, Anakin!

ANAKIN: It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?

PADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

ANAKIN: What things?

PADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

PADME: He cares about us.

ANAKIN: Us??!

PADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you.

ANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.

PADME: Anakin, all I want is your love.

ANAKIN: Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.

PADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.

ANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.

PADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.

ANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.

PADME: I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

ANAKIN: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.

PADME: I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I
can't follow.

ANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan?

PADME: Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.

ANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!

PADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.

PADME: No!

ANAKIN: You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!

PADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...

ANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to choke.

OBI-WAN: Let her go, Anakin.

ANAKIN: What have you and she been up to?

OBI-WAN: Let her go!

ANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.

ANAKIN: You turned her against me.

OBI-WAN: You have done that yourself.

ANAKIN: You will not take her from me.

ANAKIN throws off his cloak.

OBI-WAN: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.

OBI-WAN flings off his cloak.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.

They circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.

ANAKIN: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.

OBI-WAN: Your new Empire?

ANAKIN: Don't make me kill you.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.

ANAKIN: If you're not with me, you're my enemy.

OBI-WAN: Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.

(ignites his lightsaber)

ANAKIN: You will try.

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.

ANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword fight. ANAKIN throws CONTAINERS at OBI-WAN using the Force.
They work their way off the landing platform and into the main entry hallway. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN, and OBI-WAN drops to a lower level.
ARTOO BEEPS his concern and rushes to the unconscious PADME's aid.

196 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT

YODA enters, using the Force to throw two RED GUARDS against the wall, knocking them unconscious. DARTH SIDIOUS turns his chair toward YODA. MAS AMEDDA stands behind SIDIOUS's desk.

YODA: I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Master Yoda, you survived.

YODA: Surprised?

DARTH SlDIOUS: Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.

The Dark Lord raises his arms, and LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot out, surrounding YODA.
YODA is picked up and thrown across the room, hitting the wall and sliding down in a crumpled heap. DARTH SIDIOUS chuckles.

197 INT. MUSTAFAR-PASSAGES TO MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move their fight toward the main control center. As the laser swords fly, bits of the hallway are cut up. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump and use every trick in the Jedi book.

198 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO CRUISER-DAY

R2-D2, tries to drag PADME on board the Naboo Cruiser. C-3PO pokes his head out of the ship's doorway.

C-3PO: What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!!

C-3PO starts down the ramp.

199 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT

MAS AMEDDA leaves the room. PALPATINE approaches a stunned YODA.

DARTH SlDIOUS: I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.

YODA: Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.

YODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.

YODA: (continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.

DARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the Dark Lord.

YODA: (continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??

YODA ignites his lightsaber.

DARTH SlDIOUS: You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.

DARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.

YODA: Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.

Their swords CLASH. The battle is extremely fast and furious.


200 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

View screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room.

ANAKIN: Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.

OBI-WAN: I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you.

ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKIN’s lightsaber as he falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same.

201 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

PALPATINE seeks refuge in the vast Senate Chamber. He gets into the Chancellor's Podium and it starts to rise up into the Arena. YODA makes a giant leap into the control pod. The sword fighting is intense in the confined space.

202 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

The battle intensifies.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.

OBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment.

ANAKIN: You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to block OBI-WAN.
Both combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels.
They regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN away.
They battle around the room, and eventually the door to the exterior is knocked open. They continue battling out onto the balcony.

203 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

YODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord's lightning bolts.

The energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed.

YODA: Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.

YODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another.

YODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment.

YODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium. PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA.

204 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY-DAY

ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN down a narrow balcony outside the Control Room. He rips objects off the wall and throws them at OBI-WAN as he pushes him further and further along the walkway.

The balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava.

ANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control panel.
ALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN.

205 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY, PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER, MAIN COLLECTION PLANT-DAY

ANAKIN, following OBI-WAN, jumps down onto the flexing pipe, lands, and resumes fighting.

206 INT. MUSTAFAR-PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER-DAY

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN work their way across the small pipe, fighting ferociously as they go. OBI-WAN slips, throws his lightsaber up in the air, grabs on to the pipe, swings around, grabs on to an upper pipe, retrieves his lightsaber, and lands back on the original pipe. They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant.

207 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING CHUTE-NIGHT

YODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He talks on his comlink.

YODA: Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

BAIL ORGANA: (in speeder) There aren't many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.

208 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

A Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE (4477) and SEVERAL OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda 's body.

CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: There is no sign of his body, sir.

MAS AMEDDA: Then he is not dead.

PALPATINE: Double your search.

CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: Yes sir. Right away, sir.

PALPATINE: (to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.

MAS AMEDDA: Yes, Master.

PALPATINE: I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

PALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in scattered pods.

209 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover.
Support for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river.

It bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava.

210 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT

BAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to a long row of recessed lights. Suddenly YODA falls out of one of the light recesses and lands in the Speeder. BAIL guns it and heads away from the Senate Building.

211 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S SPEEDER-NIGHT

YODA straightens himself out.

YODA: Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.

YODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.

212 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

OBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other.

213 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

C-3PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R2-D2 nervously looks on. BEEPING.

C-3PO: I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight.

C-3PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff.

214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.

SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.

OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.

ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.

OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.

OBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.

ANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .

OBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.

ANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

OBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost!

ANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.

ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.

OBI-WAN: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

ANAKIN: You underestimate my power!

OBI-WAN: Don't try it.

ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.

ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.

OBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.

ANAKIN: I hate you!

OBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

ANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.

215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.

He runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.

216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.

C-3PO: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.

OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.

217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

PADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.

PADME: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?

OBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her.
OBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot's station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.

218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

ANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies overhead and lands.

219 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLE-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS walks in front of the CLONE TROOPERS on his way to get to Anakin at the edge of the lava pit.

221 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.

CLONE CAPTAIN: Yes sir. Right away.

Several of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN's forehead.

222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT

On the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates.

YODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...

QUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.

YODA: Eternal consciousness.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.

YODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.

YODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.

YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.

BAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER. DARTH SIDIOUS follows the capsule into the ship. The ship takes off.

224 EXT. POLIS MASSA-LANDING PLATFORM-NIGHT

OBI-WAN lands the Naboo Cruiser on the landing platform of the isolated post of Polis Massa. YODA and BAIL ORGANA, along with a FEW GROUND CREW, are waiting as the ramp lowers and OBI-WAN emerges, carrying the unconscious PADME in his arms, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO.

BAIL ORGANA: We'll take her to the medical center, quickly.

225 EXT. LANDING PLATFORM-CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

226 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT

POLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting.

MEDICAL DROID: Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.

OBI-WAN: She's dying?

MEDICAL DROID: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.

BAIL ORGANA: Babies??!!

MEDICAL DROID: She's carrying twins.

YODA: Save them, we must. They are our last hope.

The MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.

C-3PO: It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.

227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm.

228 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT

The TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand.

OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme.

PADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY.

MEDICAL DROID: It's a boy.

PADME: Luke . . .

PADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.

MEDICAL DROID: ... and a girl.

PADME: . . . Leia.

R2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space.

229 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

VADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly. The helmet is fitted and VADER begins breathing.

230 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT

OBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her.

OBI-WAN: You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.

PADME: I can't . . .

PADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN's hand. She is holding Anakin's japor snippet.

OBI-WAN: Save your energy.

PADME: Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .

A last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.

231 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.

MEDICAL DROID: My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Good. Good.

The DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.

DARTH SIDIOUS: (continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?

DARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.

DARTH VADER: Yes, My Master.

DARTH VADER looks around the room.

DARTH VADER: (continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?

DARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.

DARTH SIDIOUS: I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.

A LOW GROAN emanates from Vader's mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS.

DARTH VADER: I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!

VADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren't so lucky. VADER'S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.

232 EXT. NABOO-ALDERAAN STARCRUISER

BAIL ORGANA's Starcruiser approaches the city of Theed.

233 INT. ALDERAAN CRUISER-CONFERENCE ROOM

YODA: Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.

OBI-WAN: We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.

YODA: Split up, they should be.

BAIL ORGANA: My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.

OBI-WAN: And what of the boy?

YODA: To Tatooine. To his family, send him.

OBI-WAN: I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?

YODA: Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.

BAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.

YODA: (continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.

OBI-WAN: Training??

YODA: An old friend has learned the path to immortality.

OBI-WAN: Who?

YODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?

YODA: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.

OBI-WAN: I will be able to talk with him?

Rough Draft [First of four major screenplay drafts]
Lucasfilm Ltd.
5/74

1.  FADE IN:

SPACE

A sea of stars is broken by the vast blue surface of the planet, Utapau.  Five
small moons slowly drift into view from the far side of the planet.  The main
titles are followed by a roll-up:

Until the recent Great Rebellion, the Jedi Bendu were the most feared warriors
in the universe.  For one hundred thousand years, generations of Jedi
perfected their art as the personal bodyguards of the emperor.  They were the
chief architects of the invincible Imperial Space Force which expanded the
Empire across the galaxy, from the celestial equator to the farthest reaches
of the Great Rift.

Now these legendary warriors are all but extinct.  One by one they have been
hunted down and destroyed as enemies of the New Empire by a ferocious and
sinister rival warrior sect, the Knights of Sith.

A small silver spacecraft emerges from behind one of the Utapau moons.  The
deadly little fightercraft speeds past several of the moons, until it finally
goes into orbit around the fourth moon.

2.  WASTELAND - FOURTH MOON - UTAPAU

A harsh gale blows across the bleak grey surface of the Fourth Moon.  The
leaden sky presses down on a lone figure, Annikin Starkiller, a tall, heavy-
set boy of eighteen.  He slowly makes his way across the canyon floor.  The
heavy winds whip at him and make the going extremely difficult.  His face is
covered by a breath mask and goggles.  He stops for a second to adjust the
shoulder strap on his chrome multiplelaser rifle.  Something in the sky
catches his eye, and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from
his belt.  He stands transfixed for a few moments, studying the heavens, then
turns and rushes back in the direction from which he came.

3.  SUPPLY HUT - FOURTH MOON - UTAPAU

A spacecraft, half buried in the dust, rests next to the remains of an
abandoned supply shack.  Annikin makes his way across the colorless landscape
and rushes into the crumbling building.  The interior of the hut is shabby,
but manages to abate the howling winds.  Seated in front of a thermoheater are
Annikin's father, Kane, and his young brother, Deak.  Kane is a large, burly
man, wearing the distinctive robes of a Jedi.  Deak is ten years old, with
dusty blond hair and a large scratch on his cheek.  Annikin slams the door and
removes his gear.  His ruggedly handsome face is caked with many layers of
dust.

ANNIKIN
Dad!  Dad!...They've found us!

Deak looks up from a small cube he has been studying.  His father whacks him
across the shoulder with a braided wire connector.

KANE
Continue with the problem.  Your concentration is worse than your brother's.
(to Annikin) How many?

ANNIKIN
Only one this time.  A Banta Four.

KANE
Good.  We may not have to repair this old bucket after all.  Prepare yourself.

DEAK
Me too!

KANE
Do you have the answer?

DEAK
I think it's the Corbet dictum:  "What is, is without."

Kane smiles.  This is the correct answer.  Annikin is strapping on a utility
belt with chrome laserpistols and lasersword.  Kane rises and starts for his
equipment.

DEAK (Con't)
Ahhh, Pop...

KANE
Deak, do you feel you're ready?

DEAK
Yes, sir.  I've outmarked Annikin in twelve disciplines.  I'm as good...

KANE
All right, son, get your gear.

Deak jumps up with the enthusiasm available only to a ten-year-old and grabs
his gear.  His father frowns and shakes his head.

4.  WASTELAND BLUFF - FOURTH MOON - UTAPAU

Kane Starkiller and his two sons carefully make their way up a rock bluff
overlooking the parked silver Sith spacecraft.  Kane inspects the craft with
his electrobinoculars.

KANE
No tracks.  Bi-lock hasn't been opened....Interior systems are still on....

ANNIKIN
Are we going to wait for him to come out?

KANE
He's not in there....He's baiting us.  I'm surprised they only sent one this
time.  We must be wearing them down, or they must think this knight is
something special....Stay on guard, and keep hidden.  I'm going to work my way
across the ridge and call his bluff.  Better we meet in open combat than wait
for him to ambush us....Keep your guard!

Kane leaves his two sons and  moves off along the obscured ridge.  Annikin and
Deak watch him intently.  Annikin throws down his multiplelaser rifle in
disgust.

ANNIKIN
He should have let me go with him....He's getting too old to make an open
challenge.

DEAK
He's not too old to realize you'd just get in the way.

Annikin ignores his little brother's remark and sneaks a look over the ridge
at the Sith spacecraft.  Kane moves out of the rocks some distance away and
starts toward the starship.  Deak moves to the ridge next to his brother, his
chrome laserrifle sparkling in the reflected light of Utapau.

DEAK
He's making his move....

ANNIKIN
Watch your guard...and cover that weapon.  It shines like a beacon.

Deak reluctantly move away and watches the other direction.  Kane has almost
reached the Sith spacecraft and still there is no sign of its occupant.

DEAK
What's happening?

ANNIKIN
Nothing.  I don't like it.

Kane carefully moves to the main hatch of the starship.  He kicks a valve and
the hatch drops open with a loud clank and rushing gas.  Annikin becomes more
tense as his father carefully moves inside the spacecraft.  Everything is
still.  Even the continual winds seem to have died down.  Moments pass with no
sign of activity inside the enemy starship.  Annikin watches the craft with
his electrobinoculars.  The waiting becomes unbearable.

ANNIKIN
Something's happened!  He's been in there too long.

DEAK
Let me look!  Stand my guard.

Deak takes the electrobinoculars from his brother and studies the silent
spacecraft.  Annikin impatiently scans the opposite horizon.

DEAK
I think the power just went off.  We'd better wait here until someone comes
out.

ANNIKIN
What if he needs help?

DEAK
The power went back on again....

With the aid of the electrobinoculars, Deak watches the running lights of the
starship flash on and off.  Suddenly, something huge moves in front of his
field of view.  Before either of the two young boys can react, a large,
sinister Sith warrior in black robes and a face mask looms over them.  He
carries a long lasersword which cuts young Deak down before he or his brother
are able to raise their weapons.  The startled Annikin backs away in horror,
then settles down and ignites his lasersword, which creates an eerie red glow.

He stumbles over rocks as he attempts to avoid the charging Sith knight.  The
evil warrior swings his mighty lasersword, but Annikin manages to deflect the
intended deathblow.

Finally, Annikin is able to assume a defensive stance, and the two warriors
stand, sizing up each other.  The black knight is at least seven feet tall,
and dwarfs the young Jedi.  They stand for a few moments, almost frozen, then
in a flurry of blows, laserswords clash with the sound of electric snapping
and popping.  Annikin is barely able to hold his own against the experienced
knight.  Many blows are exchanged before the Sith warrior is able to back
Annikin up against a deep crevasse.  Annikin stumbles and almost falls over
the cliff to his death.

The black knight suddenly senses something behind him and whirls around to
face Annikin's father, Kane Starkiller, a Jedi Bendu master.  The Sith warrior
raises his lasersword, but is cut in two before he can bring it down again.
Kane moves to the fallen black knight, and studies him carefully.  Annikin,
still a little wobbly from the whole experience, attempts to stand.  Kane sees
his dead son Deak, and goes to him.  He lifts him into his arms and begins to
weep.  Annikin stands bewildered, watching his father cradle his dead brother.

5.  INTERIOR SITH STARSHIP - WASTELAND CANYON - UTAPAU

Kane Starkiller slides into one of the four seats of the small Sith starship.
Through the front viewing canopy, he watches Annikin drag his younger
brother's body to a small crevasse.  Annikin places a small locket around his
brother's neck, makes a complicated sign with his hand, and dumps the body
into the shallow depression.  The giant engines of the spacecraft begin to
whine, kicking up large clouds of dust.

Annikin climbs into the seat beside his father and removes his breath mask and
goggles.  There are tears in his eyes.  Father and son look out across the
wasteland towards Deak's grave.  The thunderous clap of an explosion is
followed by a small mushroom cloud rising out of the depression.  Annikin
throws a container down in a fit of rage.

ANNIKIN
How many more of them are there?  I want to finish it, once and for all!  I'm
sick of running...when will it stop?

Annikin's father waits silently until his son's tirade is finished.  Annikin
sits silently for a few moments.

ANNIKIN (con't)
I'm sorry.

KANE
Son, plot a course for Aquilae.

Annikin lights up like a Bantha at feeding time.

ANNIKIN
Aquilae!!  You mean we're going home?

KANE
We both need a rest.

Kane pulls back on the throttle, and the powerful spaceship lifts off the
surface of the Fourth Moon of Utapau.

6.  CLOUD SEA - ALDERAAN

A title card appears over a sea of billowing clouds on the gaseous planet of
Alderaan:

Alderaan:  Capital of the New Galactic Empire.

The towering white oxide clouds pass, revealing the Imperial city of Alderaan.

The magnificent domed and gleaming city is perched, mushroom-like, on a tall
spire, which disappears deep into the misty surface of the planet.  The
peacefulness of this nebulous idyll is broken by the increasing wail of ion
engines.   Four sleek stardestroyers, from the Imperial Third Fleet, burst
from one of the huge cumulus range.  The craft are flying in a tight formation
as they bank steeply, and head toward the Imperial capital of the galaxy.

7.  INTERIOR OF STARDESTROYER - ALDERAAN

Stardestroyers are two-man spacecraft crammed with sophisticated electronic
weaponry.  The pilot and gunnery officers sit side-by-side, surrounded by
lighted readouts and switches.  They wear the gleaming black uniforms of the
Empire.

PILOT
Tok-One to chicks:  Shape it up.  Let's make it good.

CHICK-ONE
Does that glare bother you?

PILOT
Use your face shield, Chick-One.

The pilot is cold and professional as he maneuvers his craft closer to the
others.  The positions of the ships are displayed on a readout, along with a
graphic representation of the city.  The pilot gives the gunner a quick look
before he flips his sunshield over his eyes.

PILOT
Here we go.  Count:  three, two, one, now!

8.  REVIEW STAND - PLAZA OF THE DADERS - ALDERAAN

On a huge, austere platform stands the dark Cos Dashit, Lord of Alderaan,
Consul to the Supreme Tribunal, and ruler of the Galactic Empire.  He is a
thin, grey-looking man, with an evil mustache which hangs limply over his
insipid lip.  Standing at rigid attention on his right are several generals,
dressed in the black and grey uniform of the realm.  Five members of the
Supreme Tribunal sit off to the side.  On the emperor's left stands Crispin
Hoedaack, newly appointed Governor of the Aquilaean Systems, a young,
treacherous man with stone-cut, angular features and piercing grey eyes.

They all gaze skyward, as the four gleaming stardestroyers scream low overhead
in an impressive barrel-roll formation.  As the sound of the spacecraft
resonates throughout the glass canyon of the Plaza, the group of dignitaries
return their attention to the parade of Imperial shock troops, and giant air
tanks (which ride magically two to three feet above the ground).

The Plaza of the Daders is filled with a hundred rows of troops as the last
brigade marches into position.  The sound of a thousand men snapping to
attention is followed by a strange silence.  A light wind blows the great red
banner of the Empire, creating a subtle flapping sound.  The emperor's
amplified voice startles many of the troops as it cuts through the quiet.

EMPEROR
Upon this battle depends the survival of the Galactic Empire.  Upon this
battle depends the life and long continuity of our civilization.  Not since
the great Jedi Rebellion has our destiny been placed in such a balance.  This
is to be the most magnificent campaign of all!  You have never been called
without doing something to be remembered, something notable and striking.  The
conquering of the Aquilaean System, the last of the independent Systems, and
the last refuge of the outlawed, vile sect of the Jedi, will have such
important and lasting consequences, that I can't but consider it as an epoch
in history.

To the rear of the Plaza, watching the spectacle over the shoulder of a
curious bureaucrat, stands Clieg Whitsun, a tall, blond young man about twenty
years old.  He seems interested in what the emperor has to say, but keeps
looking around nervously as if someone were after him.  His arm rests across
his head, as he carefully but coolly adjusts a glowing blue ring on his index
finger.  The emperor nears the end of his speech.
        Crispin Hoedaack has moved up to stand next to the sinister monarch.
The troops shout an Imperial salute in response to a particularly partisan
statement.

EMPEROR (con't)
...I have personally asked the Aquilaeans to accept this Treaty of Alliance.
During the long period of negotiation, they have only decided to be undecided.

We will barter no longer.  Governor Hoedaack has been appointed the First Lord
of the Aquilaean System and Surrounding Territories.  This is the last
frontier and the final stone in the great wall of the Galactic Empire.

The troops cheer, ad the emperor escorts Hoedaack inside.  Whitsun moves
quickly away from the Plaza, passing through several check stations, where he
is forced to show his identification.

9.  NIGHT CLUB - ALDERAAN

Whitsun walks into the glass and chrome splendor of one of the famous
nightclubs of Alderaan.  He moves to the long mirrored bar, and sits next to a
rough-looking man, Bail Antilles, dressed in the distinctive gold and furs of
the Galactic traders.

WHITSUN
Your glass is empty.

Whitsun speaks into a small intercom on the bar front.

WHITSUN (con't)
A dantic and...

He looks in Antilles' glass.

ANTILLES
No thanks, Whitsun.  I've had enough.

WHITSUN
Just a dantic then.  Bail, it's not like you to refuse a drink.  You're going
to give Galactic traders a bad name.

A drink appears magically from a small elevator in the bar.  Whitsun takes it,
and then places a pen-like transmitter he has taken from his pocket next to
the intercom.  It creates a low electronic buzz.

10.  BAR OBSERVATION CENTER - ALDERAAN

A controller sitting in front of a row of monitors taps his headphones, then
flips a switch back and forth a couple of times.  He is obviously annoyed.

CONTROLLER
Number eighteen is out again.  Give me a maintenance check.

The controller yawns and puts his feet up on the control panel.

11.  NIGHTCLUB - ALDERAAN

Whitsun leans in close to Antilles.  He is suddenly very serious.

ANTILLES
Whitsun, we've got problems.  They've just grounded all spacecraft, including
trade frigates.  Even the ships under Imperial registry can't move.  Something
big is up.

WHITSUN
I'm afraid they're not waiting for the Alliance Treaty.  They're already
moving against the System.  I've got to get word back.

ANTILLES
The chrome companies are protesting the embargo, but it's going to take some
time.

WHITSUN
Isn't anything moving?

ANTILLES
Military ships, but...

They are interrupted by an Imperial officer, and several stormtroopers.   The
officer shouts over the P.A. system, as the troops rush to block the exits.
Whitsun and the Galactic trader are tense, but remain cool.

OFFICER
Attention:  all Captains and First Officers of Guild Trade frigates will
accompany me to the Ministry of Transport immediately.

Antilles gives Whitsun a hopeless look as the troops check their papers, and
then take Antilles away.   A small fight breaks out in the back of the
nightclub as one of the trader captains expresses his dislike of the Empire.
Whitsun slams his glass to the bar in a gesture of hate and frustration.

12.  GOVERNOR HOEDAACK'S QUARTERS - ALDERAAN

The large, white-on-white executive quarters resound with the high-pitched
laugh of the evil Governor Hoedaack.  He slaps Darth Vader, a tall, grim-
looking general, on the back, and the general's mouth makes the slightest
gesture at a smile.

HOEDAACK
Success, I told you.  We are no longer under the control of the Great
Families....We've gained a true advantage.

Vantos Coll, a member of the Supreme Tribunal, and a man of the grossest
dimensions, appears to be a little worried.

COLL
A rather dangerous advantage.  You still have a System to conquer.

HOEDAACK
But this System will bring us more scientific wealth than that of any other
House in the Tribunal.  We will easily gain control of the directorship.

COLL
Don't underestimate the armies of Aquilae.  They're lead by a Jedi.

HOEDAACK
I've told you about Commissioner Lars, General.  He worries a lot.

VADER
It's a myth that any Jedi still exist.

COLL
General Skywalker is no myth.  When I first arrived at court, he was the First
Bodyguard to the emperor...He lead the Jedi Rebellion.

VADER
Seig Darklighter lead the Rebellion.

COLL
So the emperor would have you think, but I was there.

VADER
Then why wasn't he hunted down like the others?

COLL
Because he is too dangerous, too clever.  Besides, his presence on Aquilae is
still only a rumor.

HOEDAACK
Then why do you believe it?

COLL
Because I knew him.  He's there, alright.  I can sense it.  Mark my words:
Aquilae will not be easily conquered.

13.  COURTYARD - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE

A low, sleek "landspeeder," (an auto-like transport which travels a few feet
above the ground on a magnetic field), glides into the courtyard of the palace
of Aquilae.  The planet is desert wilderness, but the palace is a sparkling
oasis, with low concrete walls and great turrets spilling over with foliage
from rooftop gardens.  The speeder stops before an enormous shaded corridor.
Fountains line the beautiful and highly polished, tiled walkway.  Two young
boys, Biggs (7) and Windom (5) are helped out of the speeder by Amber, a one-
armed bodyguard dressed in the flowing white robes of the Aquilaean military.
The two boys run through the long corridors, yelling and screaming, their
little footsteps echoing throughout the palace.

14.  The palace library is a dim, cool room projecting an aura of time-worn
comfort and security.  In the distance, the children can be heard screaming
through the corridors.  King Kayos, silver-haired but amazingly youthful under
a tanned and leathery face, motions for one of his aides to shut the partially
closed door.  He is in the middle of an emergency meeting of the Aquilaean
High Senate.  The twelve men sit in overstuffed chairs, placed in a large
circle.  A large, sallow-eyed Galactic trader named Aay Zavos fiddles
nervously with a small scrap of leather as he speaks.

ZAVOS
My Lord, the chrome companies are with you in spirit, but you must understand,
they can't openly support you.  Imperial trade restrictions are very
unfavorable, and we, of course, favor your independence.

KAYOS
If there were to be war, would your frigates still supply us?

ZAVOS
Your bluntness is to be commended.  It could be arranged.

Count Sandage, a corrupt noble of the Senate, jumps to his feet in a rage.

SANDAGE
This is nonsense!  We have no choice but to approve the Treaty.  If there is
war, the Empire will destroy our entire System with a snap of the finger.
General Skywalker is a dreamer if he thinks he can mount any meaningful
resistance....And you're dreamers if you believe him.  So much trust in one
aged man.  You must see...

At that moment, all heads turn as someone enters the room.  It is General Luke
Skywalker, Commander of the Aquilaean Starforce.  He is a large man,
apparently in his early sixties, but actually much older.  Everyone senses the
aura of power that radiates from this great warrior.  Here is a leader:  a
Jedi general.  He looks weary, but is still a magnificent-looking warrior.
His face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates, is set off by a close
silver beard, and dark, penetrating eyes.  Sandage is somewhat embarrassed and
quietly sits down.

GENERAL
Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Empire would even bother
negotiating if they were contemplating destruction of this System?  Your
Excellencies, this is more than a simple raid on your resources.  You must
reach a decision.

Mir Nash, a thin, birdlike senator, turns to the general.

NASH
General Skywalker, war is a serious business...a deadly business.

GENERAL
Procrastination is a deadly business, Senator.  War is my business.  Have you
approved my defense measures?

The Grande Mouff Tarkin wears the long, black robes of the Aquilaean religion.

He speaks with a high, cracking voice.

TARKIN
An actual war with the Empire is still only a remote possibility.  As a
military treatise, your proposal has certain merits, but in the harsh light of
reality, an attack against the Empire appears to be a somewhat extreme
defense.

NASH
You must understand, General, we are interested in avoiding a war, not
starting one.

GENERAL
There are times when offense makes the best defense.  If that Alliance Treaty
isn't signed, we will need all of the advantage we can get.

KAYOS
Count Sandage, I want you to head the delegation to Alderaan.  You will leave
tomorrow with our answer regarding the Treaty.  My decision will be
forthcoming.

The senators whisper among themselves.

KAYOS (con't)
All right, then.  May the force of others be with you all.

The senators leave in a flurry of hushed conversation.  The general is lost in
thought, and remains in his chair.  Biggs and Windom (Windy), the king's two
young sons, storm through the existing senators and rush on to Kayos' lap.
The king is obviously very proud of the two young princes.  He throws Biggs
into the air, and then catches him again.

WINDY
Me too!  Me too!

BIGGS
Leia's leaving!  Leia's leaving and you gotta say good-bye.

The king picks up Windy and swings him around, then puts him down.

KAYOS
Okay, whippersnapper, go tell your mother and your sister that I'm on my way.

The two boys run out of the room and are heard yelling and screaming down the
hallway.  The king starts out, but stops in front of the general.

KAYOS
Luke, my daughter is leaving for the academy at Chathos.  Won't you come and
wish her well?  It would mean a lot to her.  She truly idolizes you, you know.

Come on, the war will wait.

GENERAL
Of course.  I'm sorry, My Lord.  Politics always seem to distress me.

The general rises, and as they head for the door, Kayos pats him on the back.

KAYOS
I know, Luke.  I feel the Force also.

15.  COURTYARD - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE

A large, four-seat speeder sits gleaming in the sun-soaked courtyard.  The
Princess Leia, about fourteen years old, possessing a soft beauty and iron
will, is embracing her mother, Queen Breha, a warm, silver-haired matron.
There are tears in the princess' blue eyes.  Biggs and Windy jump around
inside the speeder, disrupting the efforts of the one-armed Amber to pack
several plaxiform cases.

Leia embraces the king as he approaches with the general.

LEIA
Oh, Daddy, I'll miss you so.

KAYOS
The semester will be over before you know it.  You'll have a grand time.
There are so many new things to learn.  I wish I were going.

He gives her a fatherly smile, and she hugs him again.  The general stands
rather formally to one side.  The princess, her long auburn hair tied in
braids, moves to the general and he bows before her.

GENERAL
May your studies do you honor.

Leia is somewhat embarrassed by the general's formality and can only manage an
awkward smile before returning to her parents at the speeder.

BREHA
Hurry Leia.  You must make it to Yuell before nightfall.

The princess' maids-in-waiting, Alana, a short, stocky girl, and Mina, more
comely (somewhat the same stature as Leia) with long dark hair, giggle and
straighten Leia's dress before she enters the speeder.  The princess and Mina
hug Alana, whose giggles have turned to tears.  The two boys scramble out of
the speeder as Amber helps the princess and her maid into the back seat.  The
speeder is piloted by a trooper of the First Order.  Amber jumps into the seat
beside him, and the speeder starts with a low buzzing sound.  The princess
waves to her family, and Mina waves to Alana as the speeder slowly glides out
of the courtyard.

16.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The war room is a mass of glass enclosures, electronic wall displays,
monitors, and computer stations.  General Skywalker enters a control station,
followed by a covey of military aides of various ranks.  As the group hurry
through the crowded room, men rise and salute the new arrivals.  The general
stops before a giant display of the galaxy.  Small symbols flash on and off
over various portions of the big board.  The general studies it intently.

GENERAL
Montross!

Captain Montross, one of the general's aides, snaps to attention.

MONTROSS
Sir!

GENERAL
What's the TQ on this?

MONTROSS
The last frigate to leave the Imperial capital was at twenty-three forty, Sir.

GENERAL
Have any ships at all left the planet?  (to another aide)  Check with the
Guild on Horton three.

MONTROSS
At twenty four hundred, a full battalion of stardestroyers left for what is
projected to be Anchorhead, or a nearby System.

GENERAL
And no word from Whitsun.  He should have reported by now.  Captain Prue!

An older, academic looking aide, steps forward.

PRUE
Sir!

GENERAL
What do you make of this?

PRUE
A battalion is invasion force...but the Empire controls that entire part of
the galaxy....A revolution, maybe.  At any rate, they're going in the wrong
direction to be any trouble for us.

The general ponders this for a few moments, then speaks almost to himself.

GENERAL
I don't know... It doesn't feel good.

MONTROSS
Sir?

GENERAL
Put 'em on alert.

A loud uproar is heard on the far side of the war room.  Everyone turns to see
a foreign dressed warrior pushing his way past several guards and war-room
bureaucrats.  The warrior, with his long hair tied in an odd bun on the top of
his head, is Kane Starkiller.  He is followed by his son, Annikin, who rudely
pushes the pesky bureaucrats out of the way.

BUREAUCRATS
It's restricted.  You'll have to wait...(etc.)

KANE
Get out of my way, boy, before I grind you into the surface...(etc.)

As the dauntless Starkiller approaches the general, the guards stop in
bewilderment as General Skywalker rushes up to the warrior and embraces him.
The two Jedi warriors laugh jubilantly and slap one another, as the aides and
bureaucrats look on in amazement.

GENERAL
Kane Starkiller - you old muscle-rat!  What a sight!  We heard that you had
been executed.

KANE
So the Empire would like to believe.  I've been in the Kessil System.  You
remember little Annikin.

Kane puts his arms around his son, who has been making eyes at one of the cute
young female aides.  He bows before the General.

GENERAL
He takes after his mother!  (They laugh)  It's so good to see you.

KANE
It's wonderful to be with another Jedi again.  There are so few of us left.

The cute aide goes back to her duties, flirting with Annikin as she passes.
The young warrior pinches her on the ass, which startles her, but she goes on
like nothing happened.

GENERAL
What a sight!

The two Jedi stand looking at one another, hardly believing the other is real.

Finally, the general realizes his aides are standing around, gawking at the
duo.

GENERAL (to the aids)
Wake up, gentlemen.  You're on alert.  Keep me posted on that battalion.

17.  CONTROL STATION - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The general, Starkiller, and his son enter a small glass enclosed control
office.  They sit, and an awkward silence passes as each man waits for the
other to speak.

KANE
I've come for your help.

GENERAL
Anything you ask.  You're a Jedi brother.  We're one.

KANE
My friend, we've been through much together...I've been through much since we
parted.  I've lost much... The Empire has chased us half way across the
galaxy... There is no refuge.  One day they will come here... Take my son as
your Padawan Learner.  He would be a Jedi.  I've trained him from birth.  He's
reached the fifth stage.  He fought in the Kessilian civil wars and commanded
a Hubble expedition to the Cone Systems.  He's a good boy, Luke, and one hell
of a fighter.

The general looks down, somewhat embarrassed.  He scratches his head, then
smiles.

GENERAL
Old friend, you do me too much honor.  I was never a match for you.  Why don't
you finish his training yourself?

KANE
I'm too old, Luke.  I can't go on... You must finish it.

GENERAL
What kind of talk is this?  You're not the old Starkiller I remember.  Too
old?!?

Starkiller suddenly ignites in a rage and swings his left forearm down with a
mighty blow across the solid chrome desk the general is sitting on.  The old
Jedi warrior's forearm cracks in two, spewing forth wires, and many fine
multicolored electronic components.  The artificial limb flops lifelessly to
Starkiller's side.  The warrior rips open his tunic, revealing a plastic chest
stuffed with flashing electric parts.

KANE (angrily)
I'm not the same.  There is nothing left but my head and right arm... I've
lost too much, Luke...I'm dying.

The general bows his head in sorrow for one of the greatest warriors in the
galaxy and a dear friend.

GENERAL
I'm sorry...

KANE
I'm sorry.  I keep losing control.  I'm very tired...Take my son!  The Jedi-
Bendu must survive.  We must pass it on.  Only a Jedi can stop the Empire.
We're very old, Luke.  A new generation of Jedi must be started.  Take him;
teach him the way of the Jedi-Bendu...

Captain Montross bursts into the office and somewhat excitedly salutes the
general.

MONTROSS
Sir, we have picked up something!  An asteroid, or solid comet moving away
from the Anchorhead System.

18.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The general rushes out of the control station and back to the giant Galactic
display.  He is followed by Montross, Starkiller and his son.

GENERAL
Are you sure it's not the battalion?

MONTROSS
A solid object.  It's as big as our Third Moon.

PRUE
It's too large to be man-made, and it's too slow to be a comet.

GENERAL
Analysis?

MONTROSS
It's too far out.

GENERAL
I'll be with the king.  Report as soon as you can get a reading on it.
(turning to Kane's son)  Captain Starkiller, from now on you stick close to
me.

The older Starkiller smiles, and puts his good arm around his old friend.

19.  DINING CHAMBER - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE

King Kayos moves his arm around Breha's waist as they stand on a balcony
watching the giant twin suns of Aquilae disappear behind a distant dune range.

The general enters, rather in a rush, followed by the young Starkiller, who is
now dressed in the white uniform of the Aquilaean starforce.  (He still wears
the distinctive Kessilian hair knot.)  They bow before the king.

KAYOS (pointing to the suns)
Aren't they beautiful, General?  "Always and never the same."  You're just in
time for dinner.

GENERAL
I have come for other reasons.  Could....

KAYOS
Relax, General.  We will discuss it, but over dinner.  There are times, Luke,
when I find you a bit too rigid.  Is this your new disciple?

Starkiller is ill at ease and bows again.

STARKILLER
Annikin Starkiller, Sir.

KAYOS
Where's Kane?

GENERAL
He left for the spaceport at Gordon to visit an old friend, Han Solo, the
Ureallian.

KAYOS
We are becoming quite a refuge.

The group sits at a large table, and food is brought in by servants.  They
eat.  Starkiller is nervous and watches the general, to make sure he is being
proper.

GENERAL
My Lord, several events have occurred which lead me to believe we are in
imminent danger of attack.  There is no longer time for discussion and
debate...

KAYOS
What events?

GENERAL
Whitsun, our best agent, has disappeared in the Imperial capital.  There is
unusual military traffic in the S-4 sectors...

KAYOS
Unless you have direct, concrete proof of a pending attack, there is nothing I
can do.

GENERAL
By the time we have proof, it may be too late.

KAYOS
Luke, I'm leaving tonight for Amsel.  I'm meeting with the full assembly first
thing in the morning.  I am not going to approve the Alliance Treaty, and I
will get your defense measure approved.  Just be patient.  You will have the
war code.

GENERAL
Tomorrow may be too late.  My Lord, I need the war code now.  We must get our
forces into space.

KAYOS
But it must be done legally, with everyone's approval.  Tomorrow you will have
that.  I doubt the Empire would attack before receiving our answer.  The
separation of war powers is the one condition upon which you assumed command
of our forces.  You're a friend, Luke, and  I trust you.  But you're also an
outlander who controls a great deal of power.  I can't forsake my oath any
more than you can.  Just be patient.  You will have the code tomorrow.

Captain Montross enters the large chamber and bows before the king.

MONTROSS
I bring a report to General Skywalker, My Lord.

KAYOS
You may deliver it.

MONTROSS
Sir, the asteroid has disappeared from our scopes.  There is no trace of it.

GENERAL
Were they able to analyze it?

MONTROSS
It never came within range, Sir.

The general rises, quickly followed by Starkiller.

GENERAL
Excuse us, My Lord.  We'd better get back.  I will wait patiently for the
approval.

The general and Montross exit the chamber.  Starkiller takes one last bite of
his dinner, then dashes after his mentor.

20.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The general sits rigidly, facing the big Galactic display board.  Several
aides and bureaucrats rush to and fro, ignoring the general.  he is asleep.
Captain Prue approaches the general and snaps to attention.  The general's
eyes open.

GENERAL
What are the results?

PRUE
Negative, Sir.

GENERAL
Are you sure?

PRUE
Absolutely.

GENERAL
It's just not possible.  Something that size can't just disappear without a
trace...Check it again.

PRUE
That's the tenth negative, Sir.

GENERAL
I said check it again.

Captain Prue retreats to a computer station.  The general looks around for
Starkiller.

GENERAL
Starkiller!

Everyone near the general turns, but Starkiller doesn't show.

GENERAL
Where is that boy?  Montross!

Montross rushes to the general and snaps to attention.

GENERAL
Page Starkiller.

Montross goes back to his station and a few moments later, Starkiller is paged
over the P.A. system.  The general waits, watching the big board.  Eventually,
Starkiller stumbles out of an enclosed computer closet, fastening his pants
and tucking in his tunic.  A moment later, the cute female aide rather
sheepishly exits the computer closet.  She is also in the process of putting
her uniform back together.  Starkiller rushes up to the general and snaps to
attention.

The general lets him stand there for a moment, not acknowledging his presence;
then, suddenly, without warning and in one masterful flash motion, the general
stands, grabs a small baton attached to his belt (which immediately ignites
into a four-foot glowing lasersword,) and swings at the young warrior's head.
In an equally quick movement, Starkiller ignites his lasersword and blocks the
general's blow.  Everyone in the war room is surprised and startled.  After a
moment, they rush to the general.  Starkiller and the general stand motionless
for a few moments, with laserswords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing
sound.  Finally, the general grins, and Starkiller hesitantly relaxes.  They
lower their swords and turn them off.

GENERAL
You are trained well, but remember, a Jedi must be single-minded, a discipline
your father obviously never learned, hence your existence.  Clean yourself up.

Discipline is essential.  Your mind must follow the way of the Bendu.

STARKILLER
It won't happen again, Sir.  There are many new....

P.A.
General Skywalker, white com.

The general moves to a control station and picks up a phone.

PHONE VOICE
Sir, Captain Whitsun has just been admitted to Med Vac.

GENERAL
What's his condition?

PHONE VOICE
No data, Sir.

GENERAL
I'm on my way.

21.  MED VAC EMERGENCY ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS

Captain Starkiller waits in an outer chamber as General Skywalker rushes into
the Med Vac emergency room where several doctors are working on the prostrate
Whitsun.

GENERAL
What's his condition?  Is he conscious?

DOCTOR
Partially.  He's be all right - a few bruises, primary exhaustion....

Whitsun thrashes around in a semi-conscious state.  He sees the general.

GENERAL
What happened, boy?  What's going on?

WHITSUN (with difficulty)
The Imperial Starforce is already on its way, not far behind me... They're
going to attack.

GENERAL
Are you sure?

WHITSUN
I have tapes...A giant space fortress....

He struggles to give General Skywalker his ring.

GENERAL
As big as our Third Moon?

WHITSUN
Bigger.  It's unlike anything I've ever seen.  Sophisticated deflection
systems.... work in opposition to the suns.

GENERAL
They will show up on our screens at sunrise.  They'll attack before that.

The general rushes into the outer chamber where Captain Starkiller is waiting
for him.

GENERAL
Take the fastest landspeeder to Chathos.  Pick up Princess Leia... and only
Princess Leia.  Return by way of the Great Reef.  Most speed.

Starkiller exits and the general goes to an intercom and pushes several
buttons.

GENERAL
Montross.

MONTROSS
Sir!

GENERAL
Full alert....everything!  Get the Royal Family back here.

MONTROSS
The princess is at Chathos.  There are no transports....

GENERAL
I've already sent Captain Starkiller for her!  Contact the king, first
priority.  He's probably still en route to Amsel.  Use the scan com.  I'm on
my way.

22.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The war room is on full alert.  Everyone is at attention, waiting for the
command that will put them into action.  The general enters a communication
center, followed by many aides.  Captain Montross and the com aide salute.

MONTROSS
We're having a problem getting through, Sir.  There is a great deal of
interference.

PRUE
It could be jamming.

GENERAL
Try a surface link through Amsel.

The aides go back to the com-link system to try to get a line through to the
king.

PRUE
We should be able to spot them at sunrise....That's not too far off.

GENERAL
They'll attack with sunrise.  Until the king gives us that code to start the
war computers, we'll just have to sit tight.

PRUE
All units are on alert, Sir.

GENERAL (to Montross)
Have you made contact yet?  (to himself)  This is one hell of a way to run a
war.

PRUE
Sir?

23.  COURTYARD - ACADEMY OF CHATHOS - AQUILAE

A landspeeder roars into a courtyard of the Academy at Chathos.  Starkiller
jumps out, and runs up to the large, heavy doors of the academy.  They are
locked.  He bangs madly on the carved metallic door, until finally an old
woman manages to swing it open.  Starkiller rushes past her into the main
courtyard where Princess Leia and her hand-maiden, Mina, struggle with two
large cases.  They are followed by two very old matrons, dragging several more
cases.

STARKILLER
Forget the cases - we've no time.

LEIA
These are my things.  They must...

STARKILLER
I said forget them, and hurry...

LEIA
Just who do you think you are?

Starkiller grabs the princess by the arm, and hauls her to the speeder.  Mina
and the old women run after them.

LEIA
I will not be treated like this!   You bring my things.... My father will have
your head... (etc.)

Leia struggles to break away from the young warrior's grasp as he opens the
door of the speeder.

STARKILLER
Settle down!

When the door to the speeder is opened, Mina starts in, and Starkiller stops
her.

STARKILLER
You must stay.  Here, take the Crest.

Starkiller rips the royal crest from the princess' neck, and hands it to the
startled handmaiden.  The old women gasp in horror.  The princess starts
hitting Starkiller with little result.

PRINCESS
Mina's not staying...I'm not leaving her.  You can't....

Starkiller punches her square on the jaw and knocks her cold.  Mina is panic
stricken, one of the old women faints, and another starts for Starkiller with
a large staff.

STARKILLER
She'll be all right.  I'm taking her to safety...as ordered.  You will wear
the crest and continue as before.

The authority of Starkiller's voice stops the old lady.  He places the
princess into the speeder, and maneuvers it out of the courtyard.  Mina puts
on the crest as the speeder races away from the academy.

24.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Queen Breha, Biggs and Windy are escorted into a rest area of the war room.
General Skywalker sits rigidly in a chair in the communications area,
apparently asleep.

MONTROSS
Sir, we've made contact!

The general opens his eyes and takes the intercom mike.

KAYOS
What is it, General?

GENERAL
The Empire will attack on the rising of the sun.  My agent made it back.  I
now have proof.  I need the war code...

KAYOS
I'll relay it directly to the computer.  Is Breha...?

GENERAL
The Royal Family is safe.  Starkiller has gone after Princess Leia...

KAYOS
I'm on my way back.

25.  RED PLAINS - AQUILAE

The small caravan of four speeders sits motionless on the vast red plains of
Aquilae.  The king returns the intercom to the pilot and takes a small
metallic card from around his neck and gives it to the co-pilot.

KAYOS
Send this sub-land, priority one.  (to the pilot)  Get us back to Calvas
immediately!

The four speeders turn around and scream away in the direction they had come.
They pass a huge ultrasleek powerplow, planting green fungus in endless
furrows.  Two clay-covered farmers, riding atop the ponderous machine, watch
the speeders disappear over the horizon, and into the rising twin suns.  A
bright object, twinkling in early morning heavens, catches the eye of the
older of the two farmers, and he brings the machine to a lumbering halt.  The
younger farmer also notices the object, and stares skyward, shading his eyes
to get a better view.

Suddenly there is a huge, bright atomic flash on the horizon.  A few moments
later, a thunderous shaking, followed by high winds, tumbles the older farmer
from his perch.  A second flash on the opposite horizon brings another jolting
earthquake, and the younger farmer collapses, terror frozen on his face.

26.  READYROOM - SPACEPORT OUTPOST - AQUILAE

Chaos.  Red scramble lights are flashing.  Alert horns and attack buzzers
create an unbelievable cacophony.  Air warriors, with the distinctive circle
and cross medallion on their white space suits, scramble out of the low,
concrete readyroom, grabbing helmets and spacepacks as they race out of the
door.

27.  ATTACK RUNWAY - SPACEPORT OUTPOST - AQUILAE

Twelve pilots and navigators dash in unison to a line of waiting two-man
starships of the destroyer class.  Ground crews scurry back and forth, loading
last-minute armament, and unlocking power couplings.  Pilot Leader, a rugged,
handsome boy of twenty, gives his ground crew a signal that his is okay.  He
has a winning smile and a distinctive scar along the side of his face.  His
crew chief pats him on the back.

CHIEF
Knock them all the way back to Alderaan.

The canopy is closed and the powerful starship moves onto the runway.  Other
crewmen say good-bye to their pilots, some grin, some kidding - all with a
great deal of hidden emotion.  The din of two dozen retrorockets cuts through
the uproar, and six silver spacecraft leave the runway, and disappear into the
morning cloud cover.

28.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The general stands before a giant display of the Aquilaean solar system.
Montross signals the general.

MONTROSS
They're away, Sir.  Six from Gordon.  All other spaceports were hit.  The king
hasn't arrived yet.

GENERAL
Keep checking.  Put those fighters' intercom over the P.A.

The general sits at one of the intercom panels, and puts on a headphone.  A
row of monitors is before him.  He turns to Montross.

GENERAL
Where are they?

29.  SPACE - AQUILAE IN ECLIPSE

The eerie, reddish-yellow planet of Aquilae slowly drifts into view from total
eclipse.  A small, bright speck, orbiting the planet, sparkles in the light of
the twin suns.  The six deadly Aquilaean starships settle ominously into the
foreground, moving swiftly toward the orbiting speck.  As the sleek starships
move closer, the orbiting speck is revealed to be a gargantuan space fortress.

The moon-sized satellite fortress dwarfs the approaching fighters.  Every few
moments, explosions create blinding flash on the planet's surface, as the
fortress bombards the planet with a fusillade of laser bolts.

30.  AQUILAEAN STARSHIP - INTERIOR

Pilot Leader, in the first ship, signals to his navigator who sits in a small,
isolated glass bubble to the rear of the craft.  General Skywalker is seen on
one of many monitors.  A view of the space fortress is on another.  The rest
are filled with various computer readouts and displays.  One of the other
starships reports to Pilot Leader.

DEVIL SIX (intercom)
Look at the size of that thing!  Hey, Bowman, I hope you remembered to bring
your pop gun, 'cause I think we caught us a big one this time....

PILOT LEADER
Cut off, Devil Six....Stand by.

GENERAL (monitor)
It looks like they're still using the basic quad-tristation configuration.
Use a "ranger defense."  Concentrate on breath ports and lock areas.

PILOT LEADER
Affirmative base...Copy and transmit....Devil Two, check your rotation plates.

DEVIL TWO
Roger, Boss.  We're getting a threshold disturbance on gyro-three.

GENERAL (monitor)
Switch over, Five, cover it! ...Devil pack, generate a spread six
formation...May the force of others protect you.

PILOT
Settle in...Devil pack, stand by.  Mark five...break off.  Here we go.  God
save us all.

31.  SPACE - AQUILAEAN STARSHIP

Fuel pods are jettisoned.  The half-dozen fighters break off into a powerline
attack on the huge fortress.  Multiple laserbolts streak from the starships,
creating small explosions on the complex surface of the fort.

32.  INTERIOR MAIN CORRIDOR - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS

The chaos of battle echoes through the vast corridors of the fortress.  Walls
buckle and cave in, sucking debris and personnel into the vacuum of outer
space.  Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo-powered laser
gun emplacements.  Sergeants yell orders through the smoke and confusion.  Men
and robots of various shapes and sizes run to their battle stations.

33.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The monitors with pictures from the starships suddenly go blank.  Technicians
check channels as others in the war room silently listen to the action over
the intercom.  The general remains calm, but concerned.

PILOT LEADER (intercom)
Tighten it up... Devil Two, tighten it up.  Watch those towers....

DEVIL TWO (CHEWIE)
Heavy fire, Boss.  Twenty-three degrees.

PILOT LEADER
I see it.  Pull in... we're picking up some interference.

DEVIL SIX
Wow, I've never seen such fire power.

PILOT LEADER
Pull in, Devil Two...Pull in!  Chewie???!!

DEVIL TWO (CHEWIE)
I'm all right, Boss.  I've got a target.

DEVIL SIX
There is too much action, Chewie.  Get out!

PILOT LEADER
Break off, Chewie....Acknowledge.  Devil Six, can you see Devil Two?

DEVIL SIX
I've lost him.  There's a very heavy fire zone on this side.  My radar's
jammed.

DEVIL FIVE
He's gone....no, wait.  There he is...Fin damage, but he's all right.

A sigh of relief sweeps across the war room.  The monitors flash on, then off
again.

DEVIL FOUR (intercom)
Watch your back, Boss!  Watch your back!!

34.  AQUILAEAN STARSHIP

The speedy little fighters dart back and forth across the soft underbelly of
the fortress, leaving a trail of destruction behind them.

PILOT LEADER
Converge on south axis point, point three nine four.  It appears accessible.
I'm going to map the surface.  Devil Four, cover me!

Pilot Leader and Devil Four dive in unison through a forest of radar domes,
antennae, and gun towers.  Devil Four fires into the protrusions as the two
starships criss-cross the surface of the fortress.  Suddenly, a dense barrage
of laserfire erupts from a tower, catching Devil Four broadside.  The
spacecraft bursts into a million flaming pieces.  Pilot Leader reacts to the
loss of his wing man, but continues on his mission.

35.  SUB-HALLWAY - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS

Constant explosions rock the interior of the fortress.  Civilians, including
women and children, scurry for safety in the panic-ridden hallways.  Two
construction robots, Artwo Detwo (R2D2) and See Threepio (C3P0), are blown,
slipping and sliding across the hallway floor into some freight canisters.
Both robots are rather old and battered.  Artwo is a short, (three feet) claw-
armed tri-pod.  His face is a mass of computer lights, surrounding a radar
eye.  Threepio is a tall, gleaming android of human proportions.  He is thin,
with a totally metallic surface of an Art Deco design.  The robots attempt to
get out from under the canisters, but rushing gas from a broken pipe keeps
knocking them over.

THREEPIO
This is madness; we're going to be destroyed.  I'm still not accustomed to
space travel.

ARTWO
The external bombardment does appear to be concentrated in this area.  The
structure has exceeded the normal stress quotient by point four, although
there appears to be no immediate danger.

THREEPIO
No immediate danger!  You're faulty.  This is madness!

Artwo gives Threepio a sheepish look and clings to a siderail for dear life,
as debris flies through the hallway.

36.  AQUILAEAN STARSHIP

Devil Two (Chewie), a young hotshot of about sixteen years, miraculously dives
his ship through a virtual wall of laser fire, and blasts a huge radar disc
into dust.  Chewie signals his navigator, who lets out a whooping cheer, as
the craft veers into a victory roll.

PILOT LEADER
Great moves, Chewie.  Regroup at point two, zero one.  Coincide, Devil Six.

GENERAL
Mace, your map projection shows a weak point at south portal:  niner point
six.  Concentrate the attack on that point.  Coordinate.

PILOT LEADER
I see it... It looks good.

Devil Five and Devil Three bob and weave in formation toward a giant
transformer jutting from the fort's surface.

DEVIL THREE
I've got a... We're hit.  We're hit.

PILOT LEADER
Eject...Eject.  Babs, Babs, do you read?

DEVIL THREE
I'm okay.  I can hold it.  Clear me a little, Devil Five... Watch it!  Watch
it!

Devil Three wobbles a little, then drops away sharply, plowing into a lasergun
emplacement, causing a hideous series of chain reaction explosions.

37.  SUB-HALLWAY - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS

A huge explosion rips a large hole in the ceiling of a subhallway.  Artwo and
Threepio are in a state of shock as they scramble through the rubble.  There
is a constant sound of creaking and snapping as the sections of the hallway
resettle in the fortress superstructure.

ARTWO
You're a mindless, useless philosopher... Come on!  Let's go back to work; the
system is all right.

THREEPIO
You overweight glob of grease.  Quit following me.  Get away.  Get away.

Suddenly, the hallway lurches, and a dead trooper falls through a gaping hole
in the ceiling.  The foot of the carcass is caught in the rubble and it hangs
upside down, staring at the two robots.  Artwo grabs Threepio, and they cling
to each other in terror.

ARTWO
We're lost.  We're destroyed.

Three sharp blasts from an airhorn send the two androids running for cover in
a burned-out doorway.  Five grim-faced troopers riding small rocket platforms
pass the two mechanical men.

38.  GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS

The five troopers race through several hallways, and finally stop in front of
an important looking office complex.  Two officers dismount and enter the
complex.  They pass through several heavily guarded doorways until they reach
the main chamber.  Seated behind a large, cluttered desk surrounded by
generals and attaches is Governor Hoedaack.  General Vader paces in front of a
row of blank monitors.  The two officers salute General Vader.

FIRST OFFICER
All com-link power is out.  Twenty-two transformer sections have been
destroyed.  The situation is grave on all southern levels.  Com-link
communication should be repaired shortly.

The officers salute, turn and leave the chamber.  The general turns to
Governor Hoedaack, who looks a little worried.

VADER
Don't look so worried.  Not even a Jedi could penetrate this fortress...We've
already wiped out most of their forces.

HOEDAACK
If it goes on too long, we'll run over budget.  When do the landings begin?

VADER
As soon as the attack has been broken:  not long.

A short, stocky attache salutes the general.

ATTACHE
Contamination has set in on quadrants B-5 and R-4.  All sections are sealed.
We've lost two major power stations in the southern quadrants.  That puts
section 5-1 in serious trouble.

The general turns away in controlled anger and embarrassment.

39.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The general sits in a glass enclosed computer station, watching the battle
progress on several monitors.  An officer enters and salutes the general.

OFFICER
Analysis reports those ZQ configurations are definitely power
transformers...Everything in the southern sectors of the fortress is out.

GENERAL SKYWALKER
I'm surprised they are still using external power units.  It's a definite weak
point.  Concentrate on searching for the main crosslink transformer.

The officer exits as Montross rushes in.

MONTROSS
The senate has voted to end the war.

GENERAL
They can't do anything without the king's approval; which gives us a little
time...Have you been able to regain contact with the king?

MONTROSS
No, Sir.  All ground communications are jammed.

GENERAL
Send four men..from third squad, to meet the king, and escort him back.  Let
me know before he arrives.  Is Starkiller back with the princess?

MONTROSS
No, Sir.  They're long overdue.

Pilot Leader checks in over the intercom.

PILOT LEADER
All right, base one, we're in position.

An officer with headphones looks to the general.  He signals to attack.

40.  AQUILAEAN STARSHIPS

All four starships dive in formation toward a main transformer area, flanked
by several solar towers.

PILOT LEADER
Hold your fire until we're within point zero five four... Make it count.

Several ack-ack lasers begin to open fire on the approaching spacecraft.  The
starships direct their fire at a large black transformer, which when hit,
spurts bright blue and white electrical arcs.  One of the starships (Devil
Five) explodes and careens out of formation, leaving an erratic trail of
smoke, before eventually crashing into a solar panel.

41.  SUB-HALLWAYS - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS

The impact of the exploding starship can be felt throughout the giant
fortress.  The tall, gleaming Threepio races through several corridors,
yelling at Artwo, who struggles vainly to e keep pace with his stubby
mechanical feet.

THREEPIO
....I don't care what you do, but I'm getting out.  All the power's out.
Those explosions are coming from the reactor section.  This is the end.
Abandon ship.

ARTWO
Our work - we can't leave!  It's desertion.  It's not possible.  It's not
possible.

THREEPIO
Your programming is so limited.  My first order is preservation.  You stay.
I'm going to eject before the whole thing goes up.

Threepio breaks open the seal on an emergency lifepod.  A red warning light
begins to flash, and a low hum is heard.  The lanky chrome android works his
way into the cramped four-man craft.

ARTWO
These lifepods aren't for us!  It's not right!

A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the
narrow passageway.  Flames lick at the two robots.  The runt-sized Artwo jumps
into the lifepod.

ARTWO
It's the end.  Eject.  Eject.

The safety door snaps shut, and the pod ejects from the fortress.

42.  AQUILAEAN STARSHIPS

The terrified androids in the lifepod speed away from the fortress, and pass
the attacking starships.

DEVIL TWO
Object approaching.  Attack bearing...

DEVIL FOUR
It's a lifepod.  Forget it.  We've got...

Devil Four is hit by laser fire, and disintegrates, leaving a trail of flaming
particles.  The two remaining craft continue the assault.  Chewie and Pilot
Leader watch the remains of Devil Four disappear.  The general appears over
one of the monitors.

GENERAL
Analysis indicates transformer code zero three is the main relay.  Hit it, and
the whole thing goes dead.

PILOT LEADER
We're on our way.

43.  GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS

A row of monitors and the main overhead lights go on, and a trooper appears on
one of the screens.

TROOPER
Internal relays operative.  All power restored.  All contaminated areas
sealed.

An officer appears on another monitor.

OFFICER
Only two enemy craft remain operative.  We calculate victory by zero three
hundred.

General Vader switches to another monitor.

VADER
Alert the invasion forces.  (turning to the governor).  The planet is ours.  A
three hour war.  You expected longer.  Jedi or not, we've beaten him, and the
culture is intact.

HOEDAACK
A truly great prize for the Empire.  They have a treasure of biotic science.
Genetics, cloning - they've added two-hundred years to a lifespan.  Remember,
you must capture at least one member of the Royal Family alive.  The Aquilae
family has ruled this system for ten thousand years.  The people will follow
no other.  If the royal line is broken, there is a good chance the entire
population will destroy themselves and their knowledge before submitting to
our rule.

The general is interrupted by a call on one of the monitors.

OFFICER (on monitor)

We've received a message from the planet....

44.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

General Skywalker watches a giant computer display of the space fortress
mapped by the starships.  An aide approaches.

AIDE
Sir!  The king's convoy has destroyed at Caldin.  All the bodies were
contaminated.

GENERAL
I will audience with the queen.... Who knows of this?

AIDE
Many.  It came through civilian sources.

GENERAL
Confine Senator Sandage to his quarters.  Use any pretext.  Where is the
senator now?

Sandage and several other senators enter the computer station.

SANDAGE
Right here, General...It's over.  We've already relayed peace terms to the
Empire, and they've been accepted.  Your war has ended.

The general is angry and stands pointing at the senators.  They jump back, as
if the general were pointing a gun at them.

GENERAL
Senator, this war isn't over.  It's just begun.  I take my commands from the
Royal Family.

SANDAGE
The queen concurs.  I have her written decree.  It is to be implemented
immediately..... I order you to cease the attack.

GENERAL
Not likely...

SANDAGE
Treason?  Revolution?  The people won't follow you, General...nor will your
troops.  I suggest you follow your orders.

General Skywalker stands angrily pondering the situation.  Sandage and the
other senators are tense, a little afraid that he might cut them down on the
spot.

SANDAGE
Well, General?

45.  LIFEPOD - SKY OVER AQUILAE

The reddish-yellow mass of Aquilae seems to engulf the tiny lifepod containing
the two fleeing androids.

ARTWO
It's desertion.  They'll destroy us.  How could this happen?

THREEPIO
That's funny.  The damage doesn't look as bad from out here.

46.  AQUILAEAN STARSHIPS

Pilot Leader and Devil Two make a second dive on the now smoldering
transformer area.  All firing from the fortress suddenly stops.  Pilot Leader
looks back to his navigator, who is equally puzzled.  The two fighters
continue to attack the now silent fortress.

CHEWIE (DEVIL TWO)
I don't get it.  What do you think, Boss?

General Skywalker appears on the monitors.

GENERAL (with difficulty)
Base one to Devil Leader...Scramble code niner.  Break your attack, and return
to base.  Repeat, break your attack.  Confirm.

PILOT LEADER
They're hurt, Sir, but they still have power.  We should finish....

GENERAL
Break off.  The war is over.  Run on white lights.  Get back here, Mace.
We're going to need you.

PILOT LEADER
Confirmed, base one.  We're on our way.  Did you copy, Chewie?

DEVIL TWO
Roger, Boss.

The two starfighters break off the attack and start back toward the planet.
Without warning, the fort directs concentrated fire at the two starfighters.
Devil Two instantly bursts into flames, then disintegrates.  Pilot Leader's
tail section is hit, and the ship pinwheels toward the planet.  Blood covers
Pilot Leader's immobile face.

PILOT LEADER'S NAVIGATOR
We're under fire...They're still shooting.  I thought it was over.  We're hit!

We're hit!  Pilot is dead....Ejecting.

The dead "Pilot Leader" is jettisoned free of the craft, but the navigator's
eject panel is dead.  He struggles with it, then bangs on the canopy to no
avail.  The navigator is still trapped in the craft when it explodes, leaving
only a puff of pink smoke reflected in the rim light of the planet.

47.  DESERT NEAR OUTPOST - AQUILAE

Pilot Leader's dead body drifts toward his arid mother-planet.  Automatic
rockets kick-in occasionally, to direct and soften the landing.  Two grey-clad
troopers stand next to a military "landspeeder;" watching the descending
airwarrior through electrobinoculars.  Mace's corpse hits the ground rather
hard, creating a whirlwind of dust, and the two troopers rush over to the
pilot.  The younger of the two troopers, a young boy in his teens, cradles the
dead starpilot in his arms and begins to cry.

48.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

General Skywalker sits alone, meditating in the deserted war room.  Montross
approaches the contemplative general.

MONTROSS
No sign of Starkiller or the princess.  There was much damage in that
area...The queen will see you at ten hundred.

The general doesn't reply.

49.  ASSEMBLY - DEPARTURE AREA - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS

General Vader stands behind a row of men at computer control panels.  A
commander reports to the general.

COMMANDER
All enemy craft destroyed.  First and fifth division, troops and equipment
standing by.

The general gives a sly smile of approval and takes a microphone from one of
the computer technicians.  He speaks to the troops and pilots waiting in their
huge war machines for the invasion order.

VADER
The war is won.  With the conquering of this System we have ushered in a new
millenium for the Empire; which will echo throughout the universe.  Our reward
is the knowledge this system possesses.  This planet must be controlled with a
minimum of force, but you must not think lightly of this enemy.  They have
exacted a heavy toll.  Today you will make the Empire complete.  Do so with
pride and care.

Vader puts down the mike, and turns to his commander.

GENERAL
Let the invasion begin.

50.  EDGE OF THE DUNE SEA - AQUILAE

Jundland, or "no man's land," where the rugged desert mesas meet the
foreboding dune sea.  The two helpless astro robots kick up clouds of dust as
they clumsily work their way across the desert coastline.  The short Artwo
struggles desperately to keep up with the long-legged Threepio.

ARTWO
It's not possible.  We're not built for this.  You're nothing more than a dim-
witted, emotion-brained intellectual.  Why you were created is beyond my logic
systems.  Thanks to you, we're deserters, and will probably be destroyed on
sight.  And on top of that, you're going the wrong way!  All this filth is
getting....

The towering Threepio stops short and turns on the blabbering mechanical runt.

THREEPIO
I've had enough of you, you pragmatic, nearsighted scrap pile.  You go your
own way.

He picks up the tiny robot and tosses him several feet into a large sand dune.

Threepio starts off in the direction of the dune sea.  Artwo struggles to his
feet, and shakes a metallic claw arm at his disappearing ex-partner.

ARTWO
You'll be malfunctioning within a day.  You're going the wrong way, but your
way is always the wrong way.

Threepio stops and yells to the smaller android.

THREEPIO
And don't let me catch you following me, begging for help, because you won't
get it from me.

Artwo's reply is a rather rude sound, which only an electronic person could
make.  He turns and trudges off in the opposite direction into the rocky
desert mesas.

51.  DUNE SEA - AQUILAE

Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune, only to find
more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles.  He looks back in the
direction he came.

THREEPIO
You little malfunctioning twerp.  This is all your fault.  You tricked me into
going this way, but you'll do no better!

He sits in a huff of anger and frustration, knocking the sand from his joints.

52.  DESERT MESA - AQUILAE

Artwo stumbles through a narrow canyon until he climbs over a small boulder
and sees before him a sight he first thinks is a mirage.  Nestled in a rock
formation is a deserted landspeeder.  Once the little robot is convinced that
he is alone, he approaches the battered speeder and begins to analyze it.  He
climbs into the pilot's seat, and attempts to start the unfamiliar transport.
He hears a sound, and stops for a moment.  He sees nothing, so he continues to
fiddle with the control panel until the speeder lurches forward with a start,
banging into a large rock.  The stubby android is shaken, but neither he, nor
the speeder, seems to be damaged.

Shivers run down Artwo's metal spine, and again he has an eerie feeling that
he is being watched.  He slowly looks around, and sees a large man, Captain
Starkiller, standing directly behind him.  He is startled, then terrified.

STARKILLER
Where is your master?

The little robot clicks and rattles, but doesn't speak.

STARKILLER (Con't)
Can't you speak?  How do you relate your data?  You're of Karollian
manufacture...You should be able to talk.  Are you damaged?

Starkiller pokes at the machine, but doesn't see any damage.  Artwo eyes him
suspiciously.  The robot turns with a start and discovers a young girl,
Princess Leia, has been standing next to him for some time.

PRINCESS (sarcastic)
Well, General, who's your friend?

STARKILLER
I don't know.  He doesn't seem to be able to talk.  Damaged,
probably....Jettisoned from a damaged ship...

PRINCESS
What do you intend to do with it?

STARKILLER
We'll take it with us.  Could be a storehouse of valuable information.

Starkiller guides the android into the small luggage area behind the front
seat, then hops into the driver's seat.

PRINCESS
I don't want to ride with that hing.  I order you to destroy it immediately.

STARKILLER
Get in!  We've got to hurry if we're going to get across the "dunehedge" by
nightfall...You're coming, one way or the other.  Will you join us peaceably?

The princess reluctantly gets into the speeder, and it starts with a jolt.

53.  LANDSPEEDER - DESERT MESAS - AQUILAE

The speeder flies along, a foot or so above the landscape.

PRINCESS
You are such a barbarian.  I'll have my father cut you into little pieces when
we get back...and I'll take pleasure in feeding you to the Gonthas....a little
bit each day.  I may save your eyes though.  I'll have them petrified and made
into a necklace.

STARKILLER
Your sweetness is only surpassed by your beauty.  Just try to remember, I'm
only following orders.

PRINCESS
... to beat me and abuse me?

STARKILLER
I'm afraid I've only learned one way to treat wild animals.

Artwo thrashes about, trying to relieve the pressure on his crumped legs.

PRINCESS
You stay out of this.

54.  DUNE SEA

Threepio struggles to the top of a large dune.  He is dirty and hot.  His
plight seems hopeless.  He searches the horizon for any sign of life.  A glint
of reflected light in the distance reveals an object speeding toward him.  The
chrome android waves frantically, and yells at the approaching speeder.  The
sleek landspeeder races past him about a hundred yards away.  He runs after
it, screaming in desperation, until he stumbles and falls head over heels down
an enormous sand dune.  Silently, the speeder sweeps around in a circle and
stops behind the immobile robot.  Starkiller jumps out of the landspeeder and
is quickly followed by Artwo.

PRINCESS
We're in a hurry, remember!  If you're going to stop for everyone unfortunate
along the way, we'll never get back.  We're lucky you got the speeder running
as it is.

Artwo waddles up to his fallen partner and starts pulling on his leg, then
runs up and starts pulling on his arm.

ARTWO
Function!  Function!  It's me.  Come on, function.

STARKILLER
Well, my little friend, you've found your tongue.

ARTWO
We must help him... We've been lost.

STARKILLER
Where did you come from?

The little robot runs around his fallen partner giving him small electric
charges from his claw hand.  Threepio shudders from head to toe, then regains
consciousness.

THREEPIO
What happened?

ARTWO
You're overheated.

STARKILLER
Where did you come from?

ARTWO
We were jettisoned from six twenty-nine, P.R. one.

STARKILLER
I'm unfamiliar with that ship.  What type is it?

THREEPIO
It's a class M station, not a conventional craft.

Threepio then stands and shakes the young Jedi's hand.

THREEPIO (Con't)
I'm Seethreepio, Human-Cyborg Relations.  Your kindness is greatly
appreciated.

Starkiller and the two robots walk back to the speeder.

55.  Both Artwo and Threepio are stuffed into the tiny luggage compartment.
It is late in the day when the speeder rumbles to a stop in a small desert
canyon surrounded by steep cliffs and broken boulders.

STARKILLER
We'll rest here.

THREEPIO
At last.  The transport is welcome but my joints are frozen.

Everyone climbs out of the low-slung speeder.  Starkiller watches the two
androids as they stretch their mechanical limbs.

ARTWO
I've got a bad case of dust contamination.  I can barely move.

THREEPIO
What a foresaken place this is.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot
in life.  Sir, could you tell....

Threepio turns and notices that Starkiller and the princess have disappeared.
He looks all around.

THREEPIO
Where did they go?  They've disappeared.

ARTWO
Maybe they were attacked!  I sense danger!

55.  HIDDEN FORTRESS ENTRANCE - DESERT CANYON - AQUILAE [scene number - sic]

Captain Starkiller and Princess Leia hurry through a maze of large boulders,
until they reach a sheer rock face.  Starkiller looks around to see if they
were followed.  Suddenly, a large section of the rock slides away, revealing a
well-lit corridor carved out of the rock.  They enter, and are greeted by two
jubilant guards.  Starkiller gives them some orders and points in the
direction of the speeder.  The secret rock door silently slides closed.

57.  MAIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Starkiller and the princess are greeted by General Skywalker and Montross.
They bow before the princess.

PRINCESS (angrily pointing at Starkiller)
General, I want you to do something with this..this barbarian.  Where's my
father?

GENERAL
The king is dead, Your Highness.

All anger suddenly drains from the princess.  She almost timidly asks the next
question.

PRINCESS
My mother?... and brothers?

GENERAL
She's here.  She's safe...so are your brothers.  They're in the main chamber.

Leia, now looking more like a frightened young girl than a vindictive
princess, runs down the hallway toward the main chamber.  She vainly attempts
to hold back the tears.

58.  DESERT CANYON - AQUILAE

The two puzzled androids sit on the landspeeder, pondering the disappearance
of their saviour.

THREEPIO
Do you suppose we're in danger?

ARTWO
The logic of this environment escapes me.

As night begins to fall, and the shadows begin to lengthen, the two robots
begin to get a little edgy.  The sound of approaching feet startles Artwo, and
he ducks behind his taller friend.  Two guards approach the robots.

GUARD
You will remain calm, and you will remain here.

THREEPIO
Certainly.  I'm Seethreepio, Human-Cyborg Relations.  Your kindness is
gratefully appreciated.

Artwo sits rather suspiciously behind his extroverted friend.

59.  ROYAL CHAMBER - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

General Skywalker bows low before Princess Leia.  She sits on a raised
platform, dressed in the royal robes of a planetary ruler.  The queen sits off
to one side on a smaller platform.  The princess waits for a few moments
before she allows the general to rise.

QUEEN
The senate has been corrupted.

GENERAL
They cannot rule without your wish...

QUEEN
I rule by marriage.  With the king dead, I am not strong enough to stop
them... Leia is now the true queen... She must be protected.  The line must be
preserved.  I am placing the future of our people in your hands.  You must
deliver Leia and her brothers to the Ophuchi System.  They will be safe there.

General, you must understand, I had no alternative but to condone an end to
the hostilities.  I deeply believe your campaign could have been successful,
but there are things that...

GENERAL
I understand, Your Highness...

QUEEN
The chrome companies on Ophuchi have offered to supply you with the men and
ships necessary to return Leia to the throne.

GENERAL
Can the chrome companies be trusted?

QUEEN
The price for their cooperation is high.  It is waiting for you in Med Center
blue.  Guard it as you would the princess herself.  No-one must know of this
mission.  There are those among the trusted who would wish us ill.  Take only
two of your best officers with you, the most loyal.  May the force of others
be with you.

LEIA
Mother, you must not stay.

QUEEN
I am too old for such a journey.  The Empire already controls the spaceport
cities.  You have a long way to travel.  It won't be easy.

GENERAL
We will have to travel in disguise.  I must have full command.  No-one can
suspect wealth or royal training.  I fear the new queen will not stand for
this.

LEIA (angry)
Do not put words into my mouth.  I will stand for what is necessary.

The general simply smiles.

60.  SUB-HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The general walks briskly through an isolated hallway, closely followed by
Montross.

GENERAL
How is Captain Whitsun's recovery?

MONTROSS
Very good; he's up and around.

GENERAL
Fine!  Have Whitsun and...ah, Starkiller report at zero three hundred.  I want
two converted transports:  agricultural type, two days' provisions, travel
papers, weapons.  Contact Han Solo at the Gordon spaceport...I'll talk to
him... with speed!

Montross turns and rushes down another hallway.

61.  MEDICAL CENTER BLUE - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The general enters a stark white waiting area filled with scholarly looking
gentlemen.  An attendant greets General Skywalker and takes him into a small
observation chamber overlooking a large operating theatre.  An elderly doctor
greets him.

DOCTOR
Good to see you, General.  I'm afraid we're not quite ready yet.  Thank God
you'll be the one taking them, though.

An attendant brings in one of the scholars from the waiting area and places
him on a large operating table surrounded by strange looking equipment.  An
ominous looking clamp is placed on the man's head.

GENERAL
How many are going?

DOCTOR
Thirty-three of the greatest scientific minds in our System...A high price for
freedom.

GENERAL
Thirty-three scientists!  Transporting a group that size, undetected... I
don't...

DOCTOR
Don't worry, General.  All you'll be taking are their minds.

The doctor moves over to a safe-like cabinet guarded by two attendants.  The
doctor gingerly picks up a small clear vial filled with grey fluid.  It has a
label which reads:  Faubun, Astro-dynamics...In the background the scholar on
the operating table is undergoing a form of mechanized brain surgery.

GENERAL
"Bloodory's distillation?"

DOCTOR
Yes.  It has been greatly perfected.  The brain is condensed into five ounces
of fluid.  Cloning cell samples are included so that a structural duplicate of
the scientist can be reproduced.  When the duplicate child reaches the age of
six, he or she begins a series of injections of the brain fluid.  By the age
of ten years, they have received all the knowledge and memory of an
experienced scientist:  an old mind in a young body.  We have prepared a
special shock-belt to carry the vials.

In the background, the limp body of the scholar on the operating table is
removed and another scientist is escorted into the operating threatre.  Dr.
Bloodory, a portly doctor in his forties, enters the room and shakes hands
with the general.

DOCTOR
General, this is Doctor Bloodory.  He'll be making the trip with you.

BLOODORY
It's an honor to meet you, General.  I'm sure I couldn't be in safer hands.

GENERAL
The chrome companies are exacting a high prince indeed.  Politics will be the
ruin of us all.

BLOODORY
Careful.  If we could rid ourselves of the politicians, generals would no
longer be necessary.

DOCTOR
We should be ready by zero three hundred.

The doctors exit, leaving the general alone to watch the huge machine extract
another brain.

62.  SPACEPORT - OBSERVATION DECK - AQUILAE

Governor Hoedaack, General Vader walk down a boarding ramp to an observation
deck overlooking the conquered city of Gordon.  They are followed by a number
of aides and officers from the Imperial fleet.  Below them air tanks and other
military equipment and supplies are being unloaded.

VADER
Not much of a planet.

HOEDAACK
Darth, you've done well.  Do you think you will have the Royal Family by
nightfall?

VADER
An advance expedition is already on its way to their underground hideaway.
They should reach it by nightfall... but only if this Count Sandage can be
trusted.

HOEDAACK
A man hungry for power can always be trusted... to betray those in power.  I'm
sure his information is correct.

63.  HIDDEN FORTRESS CANYON

The huge rock face of the canyon opens, and two shabby agricultural
landspeeders are pushed into the late afternoon sun.  Artwo and Threepio stand
on the far side of the canyon with their guards, watching in amazement.  The
general and Captain Starkiller walk behind the men pushing the landspeeders.

GENERAL
We'll take them with us.  They know more about that fortress than any ten men.

They will be very useful.

STARKILLER
Can they be trusted?

GENERAL
Loyalty can't be programmed.  They can be trusted never to harm a living
creature, and to always give accurate information...as they know it, to anyone
who asks.  You just have to remember not to tell them anything that you don't
want to fall into the wrong hands.

The general approaches the two robots.  Artwo shyly moves around his taller
companion.

GENERAL
Greetings.  I'm Luke:  Agricultural Engineering.  We're going to be travelling
together.  You're going with us to help set up a hortastation on Banth.

Threepio shakes hands with the general.

THREEPIO
I'm Seethreepio:  Human Cyborg relations.  Your kindness is greatly
appreciated.

Threepio and the general both look down at Artwo.  Threepio gives the smaller
android a little kick.

ARTWO
Artwo Detwo:  Fusion Repair.

GENERAL (to Starkiller)
Load them into one of the speeders.

Captain Whitsun, walking with a slight limp, emerges from the underground
fortress with the Royal Family.  A small group of guards and aides are lined
up, standing at attention.  The two young princes, Biggs and Windy, hug and
kiss their mother good-bye, then jump into the back of the larger four-man
speeder.  The princess bows before her mother, then embraces her.  Tears roll
down her cheeks.  Her mother wipes them away.

QUEEN
You must learn strength.

The princess turns and moves to the larger speeder where she is helped aboard
by Captain Starkiller.

PRINCESS (fuming)
I don't need your help, thank you.

She gives the general an angry look.

GENERAL
I'm afraid he's necessary.

A commotion erupts at the mouth of the underground fortress.  Count Sandage,
several senators and ten to twelve troopers rush into the canyon and block the
speeders.

SANDAGE
Where are you going?  What is this?

In one quick movement the general moves between Sandage and the queen.
Whitsun and Starkiller assume defensive positions in front of the princess and
her brothers.

QUEEN
Leia and the boys are being taken to safety.  It is my wish.

SANDAGE
The Empire has assured their safety.  They must stay.

QUEEN
It is not my wish....

SANDAGE
General, you've gone too far this time.  (to the troops) Arrest him.

Five troops start to move on the general, as Sandage draws his laserpistol.
Before anyone can complete his action, the general ignites his lasersword and
cuts the senator in two.  He drops to the ground in a heap, and the
approaching troops stop in their tracks.

QUEEN
Stop this!

The general, Starkiller, and Whitsun replace their swords, and bow low to the
queen.  All of the troops, senators, and aides do the same.  The formalness of
the occasion is broken when the queen embraces the general.  She then turns
and embraces each of the captains.  They are both flustered, and somewhat
embarrassed.

QUEEN
May the force of others be with you.

The general and his captains head for the speeders, while the queen and all
the others return to the underground fortress.

64.  DESERT BLUFF - AQUILAE

The two speeders edge their way onto a bluff overlooking the hidden fortress
canyon.  They stop for one last reflective moment.  Forced to leave their
closest friends and relatives, the group is deeply moved.  The two robots, for
the most part, are puzzled.  Suddenly, there is a huge atomic flash, followed
by a loud rumble, and the entire canyon collapses into a large crater.  The
group quietly watches the dust settle.  The hidden fortress and all its
inhabitants have been destroyed.  The general watches the princess, who
appears to take it well.

GENERAL
It was the only way we could be safe from treachery.

65.  DUNE SEA - AQUILAE

The two sleek landspeeders glide effortlessly through the vast hills and
valleys of the dune sea.  At the base of the towering dune ridge, the four-man
speeder stops.  The smaller speeder, with Starkiller and the two robots, makes
its way to the top of the ridge.  Captain Starkiller stops the speeder just
short of the top of the ridge.  He gets out and continues the rest of the way
on foot.  The young captain peeks over the dune ridge into the canyon below.
Muted sounds and large dust clouds rise from the canyon floor.  Starkiller
immediately ducks back behind the ridge with an amazed look on his face.  He
quickly returns to the speeder, and picks up the intercom.

STARKILLER
Sir, you'd better take a look at this.  But come easy.

The four-man speeder starts with a crack, and slowly moves up the side of the
imposing dune.  It stops next to the smaller speeder.  The general and Whitsun
get out and make their way to the top of the ridge, where they join
Starkiller.  Far in the distance, crossing the endless dune sea, is the
Imperial invasion army.  It is immense.  A convoy of giant tanks, troop
carriers, and supply ships stretch from horizon to horizon.  Cavalry, mounted
on giant dune birds, ride the line from one end of the convoy to the other.
Hundreds of troops ride one-man jet-sticks in precision formation.  Their
lances form a giant pin-cushion.  It is an awesome sight.

GENERAL SKYWALKER
They're heading toward the fortress.

WHITSUN
What will they do when they find it destroyed?

GENERAL
They won't stop looking for us...They're coming from the spaceport at
Anchorhead, which means they control everything between here and the spaceport
at Gordon.

STARKILLER
Can we go around them?

GENERAL
No.  We'll have to wait for them to pass.  Starkiller, see if you can monitor
any of their communications on the com-link in the big speeder.

Starkiller returns to the speeder.  He collapses in the large speeder next to
the princess, and flips on the com-link radio, moving back and forth across
the dial.

PRINCESS
Must you do that?

Starkiller smiles rather sarcastically.

STARKILLER
Orders...The invasion force has cut us off.  We'll probably be here for some
time.  You ought to stretch a bit.

PRINCESS
Is that a command, General?  Maybe I feel like watching after my brothers.

Starkiller looks back at the two sleeping boys.

STARKILLER
They're not going anywhere.  They're asleep.

PRINCESS
I want to stay with them.

STARKILLER
What's the matter?  You afraid I might eat them?

66.  LIBRARY - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE

The king's old library has been converted into an office for General Vader.
He is sitting behind his desk as Prince Valorum, the black knight of Sith,
enters and salutes.  The black knight is dressed in the fascist black and
chrome uniform of the legendary Sith One Hundred.  The general returns his
salute.

VADER
Welcome, Prince Valorum.  Your exploits are legendary.  I have long waited to
meet a Knight of the Sith.  If there is any way I can assist you, my entire
command is at your bidding.

VALORUM
I want a tie-in to your computer network, a control center, and communication
access.

VADER
Right away!  I'll also transfer all information we have on the general.  His
command post was self-destroyed, but we believe he is still alive.... Do you
really believe he's a Jedi?

VALORUM
If he was not a Jedi, I wouldn't be here.

67.  WASTELAND - AQUILAE

The speeders make their way across the grey desert.  It is dawn.  The twin
suns have yet to rise over the distant hills.  The speeders are coated with
dust and grime, indicating that they have travelled far.  The two captains
drive through the night as everyone else sleeps.  Starkiller calls Whitsun on
the intercom.

STARKILLER
How are your fuel packs?  I'm reading minus four.

WHITSUN
I'm too low to transfer any.

The general, who appeared to be asleep, opens his eyes, and takes the
microphone from Whitsun.

GENERAL
There is a fuel station fourteen degrees by two meters.  The occupation force
should have control of it by now, so hide your weapons...but keep them within
reach.

68.  FUEL STATION - AQUILAE

A series of low concrete structures rise out of the desert.  The speeders stop
in front of an old weather-beaten block house.  The rusted hulk of a
landspeeder lies half-buried to one side of the building.  Starkiller and
Whitsun jump out of the speeder and go into the block house.

69.  INTERIOR - FUEL STATION - AQUILAE

The two young captains, dressed as farmers, enter the dingy little fuel
station.  It is quiet.  A few power packs line the walls and a dismantled
speeder rests in the repair bay.  There is a sharp dripping sound coming from
the speeder.  It appears that no-one is there.

STARKILLER
Greetings! ... Who's in charge here?

They look around the deserted station, but find no attendant.  An eerie quiet
pervades the building.

WHITSUN
I don't get it...

STARKILLER
You don't have to.  It's abandoned.

Whitsun opens a door leading to a storage area, and stops short.

WHITSUN
Not quite abandoned...

Starkiller moves to the doorway and sees the attendant, his wife, and small
daughter hanging upside down, tortured to death.  Whitsun cuts them down.

WHITSUN
They shouldn't have resisted.

Starkiller grabs two power packs from the shelf.

STARKILLER
Help me with these power packs.  We'd better move out of here.

Whitsun covers the family with an old work tarp.  He bows to the dead, then
reluctantly grabs a couple of power packs and they start for the door.
Whitsun stops for a moment.

WHITSUN
Hear that?  Someone's here.  (yelling)  We're friends.  Show yourself.

Silence.  Whitsun shrugs his shoulders and they start out the door, only to
run straight into a burly stormtrooper.

STORMTROOPER
Get out of here!

70.  FUEL STATION - AQUILAE

Whitsun and Starkiller are pulled out of the doorway and shoved into the
center of a group of fifteen or twenty Imperial stormtroopers who have
surrounded the two speeders.  Several troops have pulled General Skywalker out
of the speeder.  He acts senile, like a man twice his age.

GENERAL SKYWALKER
I'm all right.  I can still move about by myself.

A rough looking sergeant grabs Whitsun.

SERGEANT
What are you doing here?

WHITSUN
We're out of power, sir.

SERGEANT
Let me see  your travel passes!

WHITSUN
I have it here, somewhere.  We've been relocated...to a Bantha hortastation,
by Imperial order...

Whitsun fumbles to retrieve something from his pocket, and eventually pulls
out a small, round disc.  The sergeant puts the disc in a small portable
reader.  Various computer readouts are displayed on the monitor.  Starkiller
starts to put a power pack into one of the speeders.

SERGEANT
What are you doing there?  All power has been restricted.

GENERAL SKYWALKER
We've run out.  We must have power, or be forced to stay here....and become
your responsibilities.

The sergeant thinks about this for a moment, as the old, wise general watches
him.  Tension fills the air.  Starkiller shuffles around to a position where
he can reach his weapon.  A trooper hands the sergeant a message.

SERGEANT (to Whitsun)
Take only two of those power packs, and then move out quickly.

The sergeant hurries to a military craft, where he takes a call on an
intercom.  General Skywalker and his two young captains load the remaining
power packs into the speeder, and roar away from the station.

71.  WASTELAND - AQUILAE

The speeders race along through the rocky desert wasteland.  The general
speaks into the intercom to Starkiller.

GENERAL
Keep a close watch.  If that sergeant runs an analysis on those passes, we
might be seeing him again...We should be safely inside Gordon within the day.

Everyone is in good spirits.  The princess and her young brothers sing an
Aquilaean melody, which is transmitted to Starkiller in the smaller speeder.
The general takes little Windy, and lets him sit on his lap in the forward
compartment of the speeder.  Artwo flexes Threepio's arm back and forth,
attempting to discover the cause of a loud squeak.

ARTWO
Z-2 doesn't seem to help at all.

THREEPIO
It's all this filth and dust.  This environment is murderous.

Starkiller notices a small speck on the horizon.

STARKILLER (into intercom)
Object approaching, bearing three point two.

The general looks through an electrotelescope mounted in the speeder.  He
spots a distant row of troopers riding strange dune birds.

GENERAL (to Starkiller)
It's a patrol.  It could mean trouble.  We'd better split up.  You stay on a
direct course.  We'll meet you at the western edge of ravine 23-64.  Stay in
contact.

The larger speeder makes a sharp left turn, speeding off across a deep ravine.

Starkiller can begin to distinguish the approaching troopers.

STARKILLER
It looks like there's ten of them.  They're heading right for me.... Wait a
second.  They've disappeared!  I've lost them.

GENERAL
Continue on.

73.  WASTELAND LAKEBED - AQUILAE

Whitsun deftly maneuvers the bulky speeder through a narrow, boulder strewn
ravine.  They eventually come out on a dry lake bed, where they stop.
Standing not more than a hundred feet away, apparantly waiting for the
speeder, are five Imperial troops on their dune birds.

GENERAL
We've found them, five of them, anyway...Watch yourself.

The troops slowly ride their huge birds over to the speeder, and dismount.
The officer in charge is a vicious looking warrior, with a large scar across
his face.

OFFICER
Let me see your passes.

Whitsun hands him the small pass disc, and he places it in his reader.  He
studies the computer readout for a few moments, and then returns the disc to
Whitsun.

OFFICER
Have you seen any other transports in this area?

GENERAL SKYWALKER
We saw two heading south.  Goin' toward Ansel, look like to me.

OFFICER
All right.  Be on your way.

The officer mounts his dune bird, and the patrol moves away.  Whitsun winks at
the princess, and smiles at the general, as the speeder starts off across the
dry lake.  The general fiddles with the intercom.

GENERAL
S-2, are you clear?

STARKILLER
I have five troopers approaching.  Any problems on your end?

GENERAL
We came through all right.  You shouldn't have any trouble, but stay alert.

STARKILLER
Best wishes....Here they come.

Everyone rides along in silence, a little worried about Starkiller, especially
the princess.

PRINCESS
..Do you think he'll be all right?

GENERAL
He can take care of himself.

Biggs is looking out the back window of the speeder.

BIGGS
Hey look!  They're coming back.

Everyone looks to see the patrol quickly gaining on them.

GENERAL
Stop!  They're faster.  Get your weapon.

The speeder screeches to a halt in a cloud of dust.  The general and his
captain jump from the transport with laserpistols drawn.  The patrol bears
down on them, swords drawn, at full charge.  Both the general and Whitsun
fire.  Two of the troopers and their Dune birds explode in a cloud of smoke.
The remaining three troopers are upon the duo in a matter of seconds.  The
general ignites his lasersword and cuts down two of the troops as they pass.
The last turns his bird around before reaching the speeder, and hightails it
back toward the ravine.  The general jumps onto one of the riderless dune
birds and takes off in pursuit.  Whitsun checks the dead troopers.

73.  WASTELAND RAVINE - AQUILAE

The general rides at breakneck speed after the fleeing trooper.  His
lasersword is raised high over his head, ready to deal a death blow.  The
lumbering birds race through the winding ravine.

74.  WASTELAND RAVINE - AQUILAE

The intercom warning buzzer begins to scream.  Whitsun rushes for it, but the
princess gets there first.

PRINCESS
Are you all right?

STARKILLER
Two riders heading your way.  I got three, but two got away.  Watch
yourselves!

75.  WASTELAND RAVINE - AQUILAE

The general is riding neck and neck with the trooper.  He swiftly brings his
sword down and the trooper drops from his saddle.  The momentum of his charge
carries the general around a bend in the ravine, and right in the path of two
more troops charging down on him.  The two troopers are taken by surprise.
They stop their birds, and so does the general.  They stand there, about fifty
yards apart, sizing up each other.  Suddenly, the two troopers start for the
Jedi at full speed.  The general raises his sword, and starts for them.  The
troopers are no match for the general, who kills them both before they are
even able to swing their swords.

76.  WASTELAND LAKEBED - AQUILAE

Starkiller stops near the larger landspeeder and gets out.  He is wounded.
Blood streams from his left arm.  Whitsun rushes to help him.  The princess
shows a great deal of concern.

WHITSUN
It looks worse than it is.  You'll be all right.

Whitsun motions to the princess, who looks a little relieved.

WHITSUN
Bring me the med aid pack.

PRINCESS
It he was clumsy enough to get hurt, maybe we ought to let him bleed to death.

She hands Whitsun the kit, as the general rides up and dismounts.  He moves to
Starkiller.

GENERAL
You missed two.

STARKILLER
I know, I couldn't...

GENERAL
Don't let it happen again.  We'd better move out.  They might have reported
in.

77.  CONTROL ROOM - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE

The dark and sinister Valorum moves several markers on a large map readout to
form a line from the destroyed underground fortress to the spaceport at
Gordon.  An aide enters with General Vader.

AIDE
The patrol was lost, Sir.  All ten of them.

VALORUM
It's to be expected.

VADER
Have you found them?

VALORUM
They're heading for the spaceport at Gordon.  I'm going there.  Have all
security doubled.  Make it an alert.

78.  THE OUTSKIRTS OF GORDON - AQUILAE

The speeders stop on a bluff overlooking a small cantina on the outskirts of
Gordon.  The spaceport can be seen in the distance.  The general and Captain
Whitsun walk over to the smaller speeder.  Starkiller helps the two androids
out of their cramped quarters.

THREEPIO
Your kindness is greatly appreciated.

STARKILLER (to general)
I'm fit enough to...

The general gives him a hard look and he shuts up.  Whitsun and the general
climb into the speeder.

GENERAL
We'll make contact at zero four hundred.  If we're not back by fifty-five
forty, get worried.

The speeder starts off toward the cantina.

79.  SPACEPORT CANTINA - AQUILAE

The speeder pulls up in front of the low, blockhouse style cantina.  Various
strange forms of transport are parked outside the bar.

GENERAL
Take care here.  If there is any trouble, get back to the others.

The general and Whitsun enter the shabby cantina.  The murky little den is
filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures, laughing at
the bar.  At first, the sight is horrifying.  One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy,
furry, scaling arms, tentacles, and claws huddle over drinks.  The general
looks over the patrons, but does not see the contact, Han Solo.  A large
multiple eyed creature shoves the general.

CREATURE
Assha dughi wouldugga?

The general tries to ignore the creature, and turns back to his drink.  A
short, grubby looking human, and an even smaller rodent-like creature join the
first creature.

HUMAN
He doesn't like you.

GENERAL
I understood him.

HUMAN
I don't like you either.

GENERAL
I'm sorry.

The big creature is getting agitated, and yells at the general.

HUMAN
Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the
death sentence on twelve Systems.

GENERAL
I'll be careful then.

HUMAN
You'll be dead.

The short rodent yells something, and everything at the bar moves away.  The
general assumes a defensive position.  His three adversaries ready their
weapons.

GENERAL
You insist on a fight then.

HUMAN
Just try and kill us.

GENERAL
It will hurt a little.

HUMAN
We aren't cowards.

GENERAL
Then it can't be helped.

The general's lasersword sparks to life.  An arm lies on the floor.  The
rodent is cut in two, and the large, multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut
from chin to groin.  The general, with quiet dignity, replaces his sword in
its sheath.  The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds.  A figure
stands in the doorway watching the general.  As soon as the general notices
him, he leaves.  The cantina goes back to normal, as if nothing had happened,
although the general is given a respectable amount of room at the bar.  The
Jedi finishes his drink, and then leaves.  Captain Whitsun follows.

80.  SPACEPORT ALLEYWAY - GORDON - AQUILAE

General Skywalker embraces Han Solo, the underground contact.  Han is a huge,
green skinned monster with no nose and large gills.

HAN
You old stardog.  Took a war to get you out here...

Whitsun arrives with Starkiller, the princess and her brothers, and the two
puzzled androids.

GENERAL
It's been too long.  We've been through much together.  It will be good to
have you out of retirement and back at my side.  How is Starkiller?  (putting
his arm around the young Captain Starkiller)  This is his son.

HAN
You're all the old boy will talk about.  He's still holding up.  Come, let's
get off the street.

The group enters a small doorway at the far end of the alleyway.  On the main
street, within view of the doorway, giant Imperial air tanks and other
military hardware rumble through the city.  Starving refugees sit in the
gutters watching the immense display of force with a mixture of awe and
terror.  The princess stops for a moment, and stares at her people, watching
the might of the Empire.  The general escorts her through the doorway with the
others.

81.  SLUM DWELLING - LIVING AREA - AQUILAE

The seedy dwelling is dark and dingy.  The group is greeted by three
underground leaders, and the old Jedi, Kane Starkiller.  Captain Starkiller
embraces his father as the underground leaders bow before the princess.

82.  SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - AQUILAE

The princess walks through the dining area followed by Whitsun and Starkiller,
who carry the two sleeping princes.  The general sits at a large table
finishing dinner with Han, Kane and the three underground leaders.  Whitsun
returns from the bedroom.

GENERAL (to Whitsun)
Captain, why don't you take the androids into the other room for a game of
chess? ... I'm sure they'd enjoy it.

THREEPIO
A wonderful idea.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated.

Whitsun escorts the two robots into the next room.  Datos, a thin, wizened old
man, seems greatly relieved.

DATOS
You're taking a great risk travelling with them.  This whole operation sounds
bad to me.  I don't trust the chrome companies.  Time is growing short.  The
Empire's attempts at control have already caused a great deal of suffering to
our people.

Occo, a brash young rebel, about the same age as Captain Starkiller, slams his
fist on the table.

OCCO
It must happen now!  We are ready!  Each day the Imperial S.B.T. finds and
destroys a few more in the organization.  We cannot wait any longer.

GENERAL
Any uprising without a coordinated attack on the death star is out of the
question.

HAN
He's right.  As long as it's operational, any action down here would be
meaningless.  We must proceed as planned.  Are the arrangements secure?

Quist, the third member of the underground, sparks to life, and places several
discs and badges on the table.

QUIST
All passenger transport has been suspended, so we've arranged for you to
travel as the crew of a Baltarian freighter.  The boys will have to be placed
in suspended animation and hidden in shielded micro-packs.  It's the only way
we will be able to get them past the scanners.

DATOS
Were you able to acquire the necessary power packs?

QUIST
It's become a serious problem.  All power supplies have been restricted.  S-4
units are impossible to come by.

HAN
I know an agent who might be able to acquire them for us.  I'll check with
him.  It will be risky, but we've no other choice.

83.  SPACEPORT OBSERVATION DECK - AQUILAE

The dark figure of Valorum stands overlooking a group of Aquilaean partisans
who are being tortured in the plaza below.  Two Imperial officers are
finishing a report to the black knight.  They salute smartly, then leave the
observation balcony, passing Kuro, one of General Vader's aides, who
approaches Valorum, and bows low before him.  Kuro and the black knight carry
on an animated conversation; it is inaudible over the screams of the tortured
partisans.

84.  SLUM DWELLING - ALLEYWAY - AQUILAE

Residents glance fearfully from their windows as six Imperial stormtroopers
make their way through the crowded slum alleyway.  Han Solo and Captain
Starkiller move cautiously past the Imperial patrol, and disappear into the
shabby hideout of the partisan underground.

85.  SLUM DWELLING - MAIN AREA - AQUILAE

The two men enter the dingy main room of the slum dwelling, and are
immediately attacked by Biggs, wielding a toy sword.  Starkiller good-
naturedly fends off the young prince, as Han in a more serious mood, goes into
the other room.  Artwo and Threepio are helping Windy put together a block-
like puzzle.  Princess Leia comes in to see what all the commotion is about,
just as the young captain grabs Biggs by the foot and holds him upside-down.
Starkiller and Biggs are laughing uproariously.  Leia gives the captain a
stern, disapproving look, then returns to the other room.

86.  SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - AQUILAE

General Skywalker, Captain Whitsun, and Datos are in the process of assembling
two micro-packs on the kitchen table.  Han pulls a small silver powerpack from
his pocket, and places it on the table.  The old Jedi, Kane Starkiller,
reaches over with his one good arm and takes it.  He inspects it carefully.
Princess Leia sits quietly behind the general.

HAN
We could only get one unit.  The Empire's methods are proving to be very
effective.

Kane places the power-pack back on the table.  The pain from those simple
movements shows on his face.

KANE
This will work fine.

HAN
One of the boys will have to stay.

DATOS
We can't hide him for very long....The risk is too great!  Whichever boy
doesn't go must be destroyed.

The princess is alarmed, and looks to the general for support.  He gives her
an understanding look.

GENERAL
Not while they're in my charge.  Find another way to get him through.

DATOS
There's no other way.  We've analyzed every possible alternative.  You can't
jeopardize the enitre...

Captain Starkiller enters the room.

HAN
We have no time for discussion.  The freighters leave at zero three hundred.
We must get started.

Through a break in the door, Whitsun watches Artwo and Threepio play with the
two young princes.

WHITSUN
What about Artwo?  Could we lobotomize him, and use his energy pack?

GENERAL
They're not compatible.  We'd have to completely change the system...

HAN
It could work.

DATOS
There isn't enough time.  You can't do it...

KANE
You won't have to.  My power unit has more than half life.... Use it.

The withered Jedi opens his tunic revealing a metallic chest covered with
electrodes.  With his one good arm, he grabs his chest and rips loose and
miniature power unit similar to the one on the table.  Everyone is taken by
surprise.  The general and the young Starkiller both rush to the side of the
dying Jedi.  The old man turns to his son.

KANE
Trust my judgment, Son.  Serve your new teacher well.

The Jedi's breathing becomes more difficult as he turns to the general.

KANE (con't)
An honorable death, my friend.  May the force of others be with you....

Kane Starkiller passes on to the other world.  Everyone is stunned.  The
general breaks the moment of silence.

GENERAL
May he be welcomed as a man above men.  Take him downstairs.

Starkiller takes his father in his arms and is followed out of the room by Han
and Datos.

GENERAL
Prepare the boys!  We have little time.

Princess Leia and Captain Whitsun rush out of the room, as the general places
the power units in the micro-packs.

87.  SLUM DWELLING - MAIN AREA - AQUILAE

Biggs and Windy are not happy about being dragged away from their puzzle.
Whitsun takes the robots into the sleep area.

LEIA
Now straighten up, Biggs.  Remember, father expects you to follow his ways.
We are going on a trip.  There will be great danger.  You must go to sleep.
When you wake, you will be in a strange land, so don't be alarmed.

BIGGS
Are you going to sleep too?

LEIA
I will be looking after you.  Now be good boys and stand still.  Lift your
sleeve.

Windy lifts his sleeze and Leia injects him with a sleep serum.  Whitsun
enters just as the little prince collapses into a deep sleep.  Quick as
lightning, he catches the boy before he can hit the floor.  The princess
injects her other brother, and he collapses into her arms.

88.  SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - AQUILAE

The limp bodies of the two young princes are carried in by Leia and Captain
Whitsun.  They are carefully squeezed into the hollowed out micro-cases.  Leia
pensively watches as the general expertly attaches electrodes to her brother's
skull.  Han and Datos return from the burial of Kane.  The general looks up
from his operation.

HAN
He is at rest.  The Empire will never find him.  Are the systems working all
right?

GENERAL
Full power...Is everything ready?

Datos nods yes, as the general closes the case holding Biggs.  The strain of
watching her brothers placed in suspended animation is too great for Leia, and
she retreats into the main room.

89.  SLUM DWELLING - MAIN ROOM - AQUILAE

Captain Starkiller stands brooding near a window overlooking the crowded
alleyway.  He does not acknowledge Leia's entrance.  She walks over to the
window, and stands next to the young captain.  They are very close, but do not
touch.

LEIA
I'm sorry.

He does not respond.  She is moved by his sorrow, and starts to touch the side
of his face, but can't bring herself to do it.  Her royal training is too
strong to let her show her true affection for Starkiller.  She breaks down and
runs from the room.  The young Jedi continues his meditation.

90.  SPACEPORT AT GORDON - SECURITY RAMP - AQUILAE

The spaceport is very crowded.  People rush about in a panicked rush as
loudspeakers blurt out indiscernible announcements.  The Empire is in the
process of changing the boarding procedures and the result is chaos.  Many
flights are delayed, and people are running to and fro, switching boarding
ramps.  Han guides the rebel group, dressed as a Baltarian crew, through the
crowded terminal.  Whitsun and Starkiller carry the large micro-packs strapped
to their backs.  The robots follow a few paces behind.

HAN
They're changing the boarding procedures.  I don't like it.

They are swept into a boarding gate and finally reach a security ramp scan
station.  There are a great number of troops and guards standing around the
security area.  An officer demands to see their passes and orders.  The
tension builds as the officer confers with an aide about the passes.  The aide
speaks quietly into a phone.

OFFICER
Where are your component receipts?

Starkiller and Whitsun hand the officer two additional discs which are placed
in the computer.  A few moments later, the readout appears, and the group is
motioned through the electron scanners.  On the other side of the scanner, new
computer discs are issued to the group.  Everyone seems slightly relieved as
they walk through several hallways leading to where the freighter is docked.
Starkiller moves next to the general.

STARKILLER
I don't like the feel of this.

GENERAL
Your senses are strong.  It's a very small disruption.

STARKILLER
It's a Knight of the Sith.

GENERAL
Possibly.  Stay alert...Warn the others.

The group walks through the docking links and into the Baltarian spacecraft.
Several Imperial guards pass them, and everyone is ready for the suspected
trap, but nothing happens..

91.  INTERIOR - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - AQUILAE

The group stops in a narrow electronics passageway near the bridge of the
ship.  Starkiller and Whitsun unstrap the micro-packs containing the two young
princes, and check the voltage packs.

WHITSUN
Little Biggs is losing power faster than normal.  I'd better check it out.

GENERAL
Wait until the situation is secure.  Stay here, and keep on your guard....Han!

The two young captains grow suspicious of several workmen gathering around the
main exit hatch.  Han and the general enter the bridge area.  Several crewmen
sit at elaborate controls and computer stations.

GENERAL
Where is your captain?

One of the crewmen directs him to a small chamber above the bridge.
Starkiller and Whitsun strap on their micropacks as more workmen converge at
the main hatch and begin to close it.  The two robots, Artwo and Threepio are
confused about what is going on, and wear their gear in anticipation of
moving.

92.  PILOT CHAMBER - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - AQUILAE

Han and the general enter the small pilot's chamber and greet the captain,
whose face is hidden in the shadows of a computer bank.

CAPTAIN
Welcome, gentlemen.  You must have had a difficult journey.  We'll be
departing shortly....

[p. 77 is all screwed up.  I attempt to interpret here:]

[Four Imperial tr]oopers silently enter the room behind the two [??] Their
laserswords are drawn.

[end of p. 77]

The robots waddle off after the Jedi prisoners.  As the small procession
passes detention cell B where the princess and the others are being held, Han
and the general let out a horrifying Jedi scream, and leap to the corridor
ceiling, thrusting their bound wrists into the lighting fixtures.  They land
on top of the troops, instantly breaking the necks of four guards, with
expertly placed Jedi blows.  The eight surviving guards are momentarily
dumbfounded.  Han and the general grab laserswords from their victims, and
swiftly cut down the remaining troops.  Han grabs a small card from one of the
dead guards, and starts for detention cell B.

GENERAL
Watch it!  Those are cutters.

The general grabs one of the dead troopers and tosses him against the cell
door.  Red rays engulf the body, and holds it there.  Han then places the card
in a slot, and the door silently slides open.  Starkiller and Whitsun leap for
the dead guard, then notice the death ray surrounding him.  General Skywalker
grabs another body and throws it into the doorway.

GENERAL
Pass between them!

Starkiller squeezes between the slain guards, and is untouched by the rays.
Whitsun and the princess quickly follow, picking up weapons as they leave.

STARKILLER
They've taken the cases.

GENERAL
Are they aware of the boys?

WHITSUN
I don't think so.

GENERAL
Find them!  Use your seeker.  We'll meet you at the main hatch.  Watch
yourselves.  If an alarm is given, they'll gas the entire ship.

WHITSUN
Yes, Sir.

Whitsun and Starkiller each take a small humming device from their utility
belts and head down a narrow hallway.  The general, Han and the princess
continue toward the main hatch.  Artwo and Threepio have been completely
confused by the turn of events.  They eventually follow the general toward the
exit hatch.

94.  ELECTROCLOSET HALLWAY - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - AQUILAE

The two young captains reach a storage area of the huge spacecraft.  They
watch their seekers as they move along a row of electroclosets.  They quietly
sneak past a group of workmen assembling a large gyro-housing.  A second row
of micro-packs is searched to no avail.

WHITSUN
If they were discovered, they would have been sent to a medical station.

STARKILLER
There are more storage areas on the far side.

95.  MAIN HATCH AREA - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - AQUILAE

Han and the general reach the main hatch, closely followed by Leia and the two
robots.  Several lights over the hatch flash on and off.  The general cuts a
camera off the wall with his lasersword.

HAN
They're going to take off....It's too late.

GENERAL
Threepio!  Come over here.

The lanky chrome man approaches the general, who is studying a complex
computer control panel next to the hatch.

THREEPIO
Yes Sir.  May I be of service?

GENERAL
Get this hatch open.  Counterlock the departure pattern.

The robot immediately starts pushing buttons on the panel.

96.  ELECTROCLOSET HALLWAY - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - AQUILAE

Starkiller and Whitsun reach a second series of electroclosets.  A signal
appears on the seekers, and Starkiller cuts down the door of one of the small
cabinets.  Whitsun stands guard.  Approaching troops are heard in the
distance.  Starkiller quickly rummages through the electropacks until he spots
the familiar cases containing the two boys.

WHITSUN
Troops!

Starkiller straps on one of the back packs, and hands the other to Whitsun, as
they duck into a narrow passageway.  Four troops march through a nearby
hallway.  After they have passed, the young captain checks to make sure the
way is clear, then runs down a hallway toward the main hatch.

97.  BRIDGE - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - AQUILAE

As the crew makes the final preparations for the blast off, the main hatch
light blinks on.  One of the pilots notices the light and begins to check it
out.

PILOT (into intercom)
Is the main hatch secure?

98.  MAIN HATCH - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - AQUILAE

The intercom sparks to life, and the general answers it.

GENERAL
Everything looks secure, but give me a minute to check it out.

PILOT
All right... Stand by.

The general gives a wink to Han, as Threepio continues his attempt to override
the hatch computer.

99.  HALLWAYS - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - AQUILAE

Starkiller and Whitsun cautiously move down a long hallway, ever watchful of
Imperial troops.  They reach an intersection, carefully check in all
directions, then rush down a main hallway.  They are about half way down the
hallway, when a squad of Imperial guards appears at the end of the hallway,
facing them.  The troops start toward the two captains with lowered
laserrifles.

STARKILLER
Here's where it gets tricky.

Starkiller, then Whitsun, quickly and smoothly draw their laserpistols and
fire at the troops.  A giant explosion destroys the far end of the hallway.  A
few laserbolts are returned, but streak harmlessly overhead, and explode out
of range.  The exchange of gunfire lasts only a few moments.  When the smoke
clears, the troops have been destroyed.

100.  MAIN HATCH - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - AQUILAE

The main hatch slowly begins to slide open, when the rumbling explosion of
laserfire echoes through the hallways.  Han looks to the general, and they
both instantly realize what has happened.  Han draws his weapons.  The hatch
is now fully open.  Everyone stands silently, watching for the two captains.
Alarms start screaming throughout the ship, and the giant hatch slowly begins
to close.

GENERAL
Come on.  We can't wait.

The group reluctantly exits the spacecraft, giving one last look back to their
lost friends.  The hatch continues to close slowly as the alarm sirens wail.
Suddenly, Starkiller and Whitsun round a corner and head for the ever-closing
hatch; battling several Imperial stormtroopers as they go.  Han and the
general move up to the hatch and give cover fire.  Whitsun slips through the
shrinking opening, and yells to Starkiller to hurry.  Many more troops bear
down on the young Jedi as he squeezes through the very slim opening.  One of
the troops dives after him, but is caught, and crushed by the emergency hatch.

101.  BOARDING RAMPS - GORDON SPACEPORT - AQUILAE

The general leads the group through various corridors.

HAN
Once the alarm sounds, the entire spaceport will shut down.

They stop at a junction.  At the far end of one hallway, several troops guard
a restricted passageway.

GENERAL
That's the military section.

STARKILLER
Fighter craft!

HAN
But it's very heavily guarded.  We can't take it with subtlety.

Before the general can answer, the acute scream of the spaceport alarm
reverberates through the corridors.  The general, followed by his two young
captains, charge toward the heavily guarded military passageway.  Han, with
the princess and two robots, follow a safe distance behind.  A guard sees them
coming, and orders them to stop.  Starkiller and the general fire their
laserpistols at the passageway entrance and the troops disappear in a huge
explosion.

The group jumps over the dead guards and smoking rubble, then runs through a
series of hallways leading to a starship.  They stop just short of an
intersection leading to a boarding ramp.  Starkiller peeks around a corner at
two guards standing in front of the boarding ramp.

STARKILLER
Cutters!  We'll have to draw them out...A blast might alert the crew.

GENERAL
Artwo!  Come here.

The little robot waddles over to the old Jedi.

GENERAL (con't)
Move to that intersection and sound the alarm.

The mechanical dwarf dutifully marches into the intersection and lets out a
high, electronic scream.  The guards shut off the deadly laser "cutters," and
cautiously approach the wailing robot.

GUARD
What is it?  What's wrong?

With incredible speed, both guards are dropped by a few precision blows from
the two young captains.  They immediately drag the unconscious guards into the
starship.

GENERAL
Starkiller!  Whitsun!  Stand guard.  I'll signal at take-off minus
thirty...And reverse that cutter!

102.  INTERIOR - IMPERIAL STARSHIP - AQUILAE

Han and the general, followed by Leia and the robots, enter the Imperial
starship.  They rush through several narrow hallways leading to the bridge.
Two crew members leaving a control station, stumble into the group and are
quickly dispatched by Han.  The princess waits with the robots, as the general
and Han enter the bridge.  The two pilots and navigator are taken by surprise
and promptly are subdued.  Han switches on the intercom and listens.

HAN
How are we going to get them to open the silo cover?

GENERAL
Send Threepio in here.  Dispose of any crewmen left on board.

103.  BOARDING RAMP - SPACEPORT - AQUILAE

Starkiller and Whitsun now wear the uniform of the Imperial guard.  Whitsun
has removed a plate from the "cutter" machinism and is crossing a few wires.
He replaces the "cutter" plate just as a squad of stormtroopers rushes toward
the door.  An officer salutes them.

OFFICER
Have you seen them?

STARKILLER
No, Sir.

OFFICER
They're in this section somewhere.  I'm doubling all the guards.  Stay alert.

Two guards take up positions just outside the "cutter" areas, and the squad
moves on to another starship.  Starkiller gives his partner a philosophical
look.

104.  INTERIOR - IMPERIAL STARSHIP - AQUILAE

The gleaming chrome Threepio sits in the pilot's seat, talking on the intercom
to a controller.  He breaks off his continual drone of take-off instructions
to the controller and turns to the general, shaking his head.

THREEPIO
They won't buy it.  I think they're getting suspicious.

Han enters.

HAN
The crew is taken care of.

GENERAL
Well, they're not going to open the silo cover, so I'm afraid we'll have to
take it with us.

HAN
We're going to sustain considerable damage if we blast off through that cover.

GENERAL
It's a thin shell.  There is no choice.  (to Threepio)  Signal the boys.

105.  BOARDING RAMPS - SPACEPORT - AQUILAE

Warning lights flash and the main hatch to the starfighter slowly begins to
close.  The two Imperial stormtroopers yell at Starkiller and Whitsun.

STORMTROOPER
Watch it!  Don't fire into those cutters!  (to Starkiller)  Shut down the
cutters!

The two captains pretend to be confused, and not understand.  At the last
minute, they leap aboard the starship.  The hatch slides closed, and the
boarding ramp drops away.  Several more guards arrive, and give the troopers a
special card, which turns the small cutter warning lights from red to green.
The guards rush onto the boarding ramp and are wiped out by the reversed
"cutters."

106.  INTERIOR - STARSHIPS - AQUILAE

Everyone straps himself into the lifepods.  Threepio and the general troddle
forward, and the giant ship shudders as it starts to lift off the launch pad.
With tense expressions, everyone braces for the impact of the silo cover.

107.  STARSHIP - SPACEPORT SILO - AQUILAE

The  mighty starship thunders out of the silo, crashing through the cover
plate, sending shrapnel in all directions.  The ship leaps toward the heavens.

108.  BOARDING CAMPS - SPACEPORT - AQUILAE

Imperial flight crews rush to their starships.   Pilots receive their
clearances, and several giant silo covers swing away, revealing deadly hunter-
destroyer spaceships.

109.  INTERIOR - BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

Han and the general watch as five hunter-destroyers leave the spaceport at
Gordon.

GENERAL
We suffered light damage to a deflector fin.  It will take them quite a while
to catch up with us now.  Tell the boys to get some rest.

110.  AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

Han retreats to the aft section of the ship, where the two captains are
checking out the two main lasercannons mounted in large rotating bubble
turrets.

HAN
The old boy says you two should get some rest... You've got some time before
they catch up to us.

Han notices the packs containing the young princes.

HAN (con't)

Better store the boys in a lifepod.  Secure them well.

He heads back toward the bridge, followed by Whitsun.  Starkiller carries the
two micro-packs to a lifepod, and straps them in.  He checks Biggs' energy
supply.  It is low.  Leia approaches him.

LEIA
Couldn't we let them out now?

STARKILLER
It's better this way.  Things are going to get rough...

LEIA
Will we make it?  Is there any hope?  Stay with me.  [something deleted?]... I
love you.

Starkiller is slightly shocked at this outburst.  The princess starts to cry
and clings to him for support.

STARKILLER
No-one is going to die...so stop acting like a child, and start behaving like
a queen.  What is this silly talk of love?  You belong to the people of
Aquilae, and my job is to return you to them, nothing more.  Now straighten up
and get into a lifepod.

She's deeply hurt by his callousness.  She breaks away from him and runs down
a hallway into a lifepod.  He is tired, and angry at the whole incident.

111.  BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

Threepio guides the starship toward the Ophuchi system.  The general watches
the computer readout estimate the position of the Imperial hunter destroyers.

THREEPIO
Hostile craft will intercept at thirty plus.

GENERAL
What's the nearest star System?

THREEPIO
Yavin.

GENERAL
Set a course... Maybe we can lose them among the Systems.

112.  AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

Starkiller rests in one of the lasercannon pod bays.  He is thinking about
Leia.  Slowly a smile creeps across his face.  He makes a decision, jumps up,
and hurries down a hallway.  He taps on the lifepod bulkhead, and Whitsun
opens the door.  Starkiller is surprised.

WHITSUN
What is it?

STARKILLER
Where is Leia?

WHITSUN
She went forward.... What's going on with you two?

STARKILLER
We're in love.  She loves me, and I just realized,... I love her.

WHITSUN
[something whited out] You're asking for trouble... She's a queen... You're a
warrior....Do you know what you're saying?

STARKILLER
I don't care... I've got to talk...

Whitsun just shakes his head, but before Starkiller can finish his sentence,
the ship is rocked by a bombardment of proton torpedoes.  The intercom squawks
to life.

GENERAL (over intercom)
Get to those guns!

Starkiller and Whitsun rush to the lasercannons, and jump into the protective
suits and helmets.

113.  BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

Han enters the bridge and sits before a fire control center.  The general sits
in a chair, slightly behind and above Threepio, directing the robot pilot.

GENERAL
Turn around!  Let's face them.

Artwo, sitting quietly in a corner, watches as Threepio punches new
information into the computer and the giant starship swings around in a sharp
circle.  Several torpedoes explode near the ship.  The general switches on the
intercom.

GENERAL
Your boys ready?

114.  AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

The captains adjust the lasercannon controls in front of them and check in
with the general.

GENERAL
They should be within range in twelve seconds...

Starkiller adjusts his giant laser ack-ack cannon, searching his electronic
tracking screen for the hunter destroyer.  Whitsun is having a problem with
one of the rotating mechanisms on the huge gun.  He curses, climbs out of the
chair, and attempts to fix it.

WHITSUN
My vertical rotating circuits are out...

The princess straps herself into a small lifepod.  [something whited out]
Only the slightest hint of concern or worry shows in her face.  She listens to
her protectors relay instructions as the enemy approaches.

115.  BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

The starship shudders as the hunter-destroyers open fire.  Han relays the
ship's status to the general, as Threepio struggles to keep up with the
barrage of orders.

HAN
We're losing deflectors three thirty one and ten forty two...

GENERAL (to Threepio)
Cut hard to maridian nine zero six.  Level to three degrees...(into the
intercom)  We're coming under one.  Wait for my signal!

116.  AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

The constant flashing of deflected laser bolts reflect in the interior of the
lasercannon bubble.  Starkiller rechecks his firing swithces..Whitsun adjusts
his headphones, and lowers a glare reflector.  He raps on the power rotation
circuits, and gives them a little test burst.  The pod instantly rotates a few
degrees.  The large starship heads directly toward the three enemy ships and
at the last moment dives under the attacking craft.  Starkiller watches the
smaller crafts pass overhead, aching to open fire.  He calls Whitsun on the
intercom.

STARKILLER
I've got no signal.  I'm on target.  What's wrong?  What are they waiting for?

I've got an open shield!

The three Imperial craft are firing incessantly at point blank range.

WHITSUN
Wait for the signal.

But Starkiller has a perfect shot, and he can't wait.  He squeezes the trigger
and the giant lasercannon, with a burst of smoke and electrical charge, opens
up on the enemy craft.  Moments later, the signal lights flash on and Whitsun
commences firing on the receeding hunter-destroyers.  Two of the Imperial
craft break off, and prepare for another attack run.  The third is hit by a
concentrated barrage from the two captains, and begins spinning out of
control, until it finally explodes.  Whitsun gives Starkiller a victory wave,
which Starkiller gleefully returns.  These moments of triumph are broken by
the intercom.

GENERAL
Annikin, next run you wait for my signal.  We haven't much power to spare on
your inaccurate grandstanding!

Starkiller's pride is wounded.  He resets his accelerators, as the two
remaining hunter-destroyers begin a second run.

117.  BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

Han turns to the general.

HAN
We have a weakened shield on the port turret...

GENERAL
Warn Starkiller.  Get him out of there.  (to Threepio)  Change your heading by
point five.

118.  AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

Princess Leia listens to Han warn Starkiller.

HAN
Your shield power is down.  Abandon that positions, and seal that section.
Report!  Captain, do you hear me?  Captain?!!!

Leia becomes worried that something has happened to Annikin.  The young
captain switches off the intercom system and signals to Whitsun that the
system has gone dead.  Before Whitsun can answer, the two hunter-destroyer
spacecraft are upon them once again.  Laser bolts flash all around them.  The
general's signal flashes on, and the captain starts to return the fire.  One
of the Imperial fighters concentrates its fire on Starkiller's weakened
gunport.  A direct hit blows open a hole in the turret, and everything that
isn't bolted down is sucked into outer space, including Starkiller.  He bangs
against the side of the starship, held only by a weakened lifeline.

The princess hears Whitsun explain Starkiller's predicament, and rushes back
to help him.  She is stopped by a pressure locked door leading to the gun
emplacement.

119.  BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

The general orders Threepio to swing the spacecraft around and start a new
attack.  He turns to Artwo.

GENERAL
Use the aft port...See what you can do for Starkiller.

Artwo hurriedly waddles out of the bridge.  Threepio and Han simultaneously
turn to the general.

THREEPIO
More craft approaching!

HAN
It looks like at least six or seven.

The general studies the radar scopes and then checks a Galactic map displayed
on one of the monitors.

GENERAL
Change course to three point one.

THREEPIO
That will head us directly into the path of the Norton Asteroid Belt.

HAN
That Asteroid Belt is too dense to pass through...The ship won't make it!

GENERAL
We'll never defeat them in combat.  It's our only chance to lose them.

Threepio punches in new coordinates, and the starship veers away toward the
treacherous asteroid belt.

120.  AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

Whitsun fires on one ofthe two hunter-destroyers which is pacing the rebel
starship.  Starkiller unsuccessfully tries to pull himself back inside the
spacecraft.  The enemy craft maneuvers wildly in an attempt to get into a
better position, to fire on Starkiller.  Whitsun blasts away, until the
Imperial spacecraft spews forth equipment and personnel, careens off, and
eventually explodes.

Artwo wobbles along the exterior of the ship, until he reaches the stranded
captain.  He attaches a new lifeline to the young Jedi's spacesuit, and makes
his way back inside the wounded craft.  Starkiller is pulled to safety just as
the starship enters the asteroid belt.  A barrage of small and large asteroids
begins to pelt the ship, causing a great deal of damage.

GENERAL (over intercom)
Secure yourselves.  We may have to eject.  Abandon the turrets.

The princess rushes back to her lifepod and straps herself in.  Whitsun and
Artwo help Starkiller make his way out of the lasercannon turrets and through
a series of locks, to the lifepod area.

121.  BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

The asteroids hit hard.  The ship is buffeted to and fro as the general, Han,
and Threepio struggle into their spacesuit-like lifepods.  The Imperial
hunter-destroyer closest to the rebel ship explodes in the onrush of deadly
asteroids.  The new reinforcement hunter-destroyers turn back and give up the
pursuit.  They disappear from the tracking monitors.  The asteroid bombardment
becomes almost unbearable.  Warning lights begin to flash.  Extending foils,
antennae, and armament pods are scraped away from the starship hull.  A
baseball-sized hole is punched through the midsection, and hundreds of objects
are sucked into space.  A large locker eventually plugs the opening.  The
starship and her passengers shudder and sway under the punishment of the
asteroid storm.

THREEPIO
The ship is breaking up.

HAN
We're almost clear of the storm.

THREEPIO
We'll never make it.  Eject, we must eject.

The general watches the computer monitor as the starship emerges from the far
side of the Asteroid Belt.

HAN
We're approaching one of the Forbidden Systems....

GENERAL
We've got to achieve orbit.

THREEPIO
We'll never make it.

The starship heads for a small blue-green planet in the distance.

122.  AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

Starkiller was considerably shaken in the destruction of his laserturret.  He
is slightly dazed as Whitsun straps him into a lifepod with Artwo.

WHITSUN (to Artwo)
You watch him.  Make sure this pod gets off all right.

Artwo nods, and Whitsun moves to the second lifepod and straps himself in next
to the princess.

LEIA
Will he be all right?

WHITSUN
I think so.. His feelings for you are dangerous.  You should discourage him.

She is surprised that Starkiller has any feeling for her, but keeps her
emotions to herself.

123.  BRIDGE - STARSHIP - YAVIN ORBIT

The general is strapped into the lifepod with the two micro-packs containing
the young princes.  Han and Threepio are in the second lifepod.

HAN
We're in orbit.

THREEPIO
We've got to eject now!  Those reactors won't hold much longer.  This ship's
going to end up in a million little pieces,... and I don't want to be one of
them.

HAN
All lifepod systems are operative.

GENERAL (into intercom)
If you boys are ready back there, we'll get off this bucket.

WHITSUN
All systems operative...I have the signal.

ARTWO
All systems operative...We have the signal.

Han salutes the general, and his lifepod jettisons away from the crippled
starship.  He is quickly followed by the general.

124.  AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - YAVIN ORBIT

Artwo pushes the jettison switch, but nothing happens.  Starkiller slowly and
with some difficulty, pushes the switch two or three times.  Nothing happens.
He begins to look a little worried.

STARKILLER (into intercom)
We've got a problem...Wait a second...

Artwo pushes the switch again, and the lifepod blasts off in a cloud of smoke
and debris.  Whitsun also seems to be having a problem.  Half the lights on
his control panel have gone dead.  He struggles to reactivate them.

WHITSUN
My power's out!

GENERAL (over intercom)
Is it a faulty switch?

WHITSUN
No.  The whole bank is out.

Whitsun gives the princess a reassuring look, then punches some information
into the computer.  The monitor flashes:  "Income line main power."  He looks
outside the lifepod and sees a damaged cable.

WHITSUN
I've found it...

GENERAL
You haven't much time...The auxiliary units have already blown....

Whitsun scrambles out of the lifepod and rushes over to the severed connector.

He works on it for a few moments, then stops with a rather defeated look.  The
princess watches him as he tries to think of a solution.  A great explosion is
heard in the forward part of the ship.

125.  LIFEPODS - SPACE - YAVIN ORBIT

The two lifepods containing the general, and Han and Threepio drift away from
the disabled starship.

GENERAL
Where's Starkiller?

HAN
I can't see him either.

Starkiller uses the small rockets on his lifepod to maneuver back toward the
burning starship.  He can hear the general over the intercom.

GENERAL
Starkiller, where are you?  Report in.

Starkiller reaches down and switches off the intercom.

126.  AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - YAVIN ORBIT

Whitsun appears to have found a solution to his situation and rushes back to
the princess.  He reaches in and locks on the power switch.

WHITSUN
There is only one possible solution, and we must use it.  Lock the hitch and
make sure it is sealed.

PRINCESS
But what of...

Another explosion creates a large bulge in the wall of the aft section.

WHITSUN
We've no time!

He slams the hatch shut and runs to the power connector.  Smoke begins to fill
the chamber, as Whitsun slams a large metallic dampening tool across the
damaged connector terminals, and the lifepod jettisons away.

127.  LIFEPODS - SPACE - YAVIN ORBIT

The princess jettisons free, as Starkiller moves toward the crippled ship.
Leia calls the general on the intercom.

LEIA
I'm all right, but Clieg is still on board.

GENERAL
Starkiller, stay out of there.

With a rumble, the starship disappears in a spectacular explosion, sending
debris in all directions.  Starkiller stops his lifepod and it starts to
drift.  He is weeping.  Han and the general helplessly watch the remains of
the explosion drift away.

GENERAL
Starkiller, stay near Leia.  Use your beacon.  Coordinate with us.

Starkiller's intercom is weak, and there is a great deal of static.  The
lifepods drift toward the awesome blue-green Yavin surface.  The general loses
sight of the other lifepods as the descend through the cloud cover.

GENERAL
Captain, I'm losing your beacon.  Send me a new signal.

All he gets is static.  The planet surface rushes toward the falling lifepods.

Retrorockets automatically kick in and slow the pods.  Two of the small craft
break through the clouds and land in the dense, steaming jungles.

128.  VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

The general's lifepod crashes through the foliage until it comes to rest in
the middle of a large vine-covered tree.  He grabs the two micro-packs and
climbs out of the lifepod, and onto a large moss-covered limb.  Han and
Threepio run to the base of the huge tree.

HAN
Are you all right?

GENERAL
Fine...Any signal from Annikin?

HAN
Nothing yet.  I think they landed further south.

The general attaches a thin cable from his utility belt to the tree trunk, and
slides to the ground.  Han takes the micro-packs from him.  The general looks
around at the jungle.

GENERAL
This is dangerous country...We'd better stay together.

THREEPIO
The wildlife in the forbidden system is extremely hostile...Perhaps we should
seek shelter?

Han inspects the power units of the micro packs.

HAN
Windy's unit is very low.  I can't tell if the unit is still functioning.

GENERAL
We have to find a place to revive them.  We'll start moving south.  We should
find protection along that ridge.

The general grabs one of the micro-packs and starts off into the murky jungle.

Han and Threepio quickly follow.  The jungle is a strange and eerie, fog-laden
purgatory.  Gruesome and unnatural sounds permeate this ghostly wasteland.
Everyone is cautious, and on the alert for an unseen danger.

129.  FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

Starkiller's lifepod is also caught in the limbs of a gargantuan tree.  The
lifepod has been ripped in half by the crash landing.  The unconscious Jedi
hangs half out of the damaged craft.  A two foot high insect-like creature
scoots down a branch and onto the back of the dormant warrior.  The insect
lets out a chilling hissing sound, and a slimy tube emerges from its hairy
mouth, waking Starkiller.  He is immediately aware of the insect.  His eyes
are open, but he doesn't move.  Suddenly, with one quick blow, he knocks the
creature against the side of the spacecraft, and it is squashed lifeless.

Starkiller is a little groggy, but he manages to climb out of the wreckage.
He looks around for Artwo.

STARKILLER
Artwo!  Artwo Detwo!

ARTWO
Help!

Starkiller turns and sees the little robot hanging upside down, one of his
three feet caught in a vine.  He lifts Artwo out of his predicament and places
him securely on a wide limb.

STARKILLER
Did you see Leia?

ARTWO
She landed on the other side of those trees, approximately eight hundred
meters.

STARKILLER
Well, come on, old buddy.  Let's get ourselves out of this tree.

130.  VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN

The general, Han and Threepio reach a shallow cave near the top of a steep
ridge.  They quickly pull off the micro-packs and place them on a clear piece
of ground at the mouth of the cave.

GENERAL (to Han)
Check out the inside.  Threepio, stand guard.  Keep your eyes on the
countryside.

He looks at the power units on the micro-packs and shakes his head with a
worried look.  Han returns from a survey of the inside of the cave.

HAN
It doesn't go very far.  There's nothing back there.

GENERAL
Help me with this.

Han helps the general lift the top from the case containing Windy, the younger
of the two princes.  The small boy appears lifeless as the general pulls him
from his encasement, and rests him on the cave floor.  Han pulls a small
respiration out of the micro-packs and places it over the boy's nose.  The
general attaches two electrodes over his heart.

HAN
He doesn't look good.

The little prince begins to turn blue.  The general grows tense.  Windy starts
to regain consciousness, but begins coughing and choking, then goes limp
again.  The general quickly props Windy's mouth open with a small plastic rod
and checks the reading on his power pack.

GENERAL
We need more power...tap off Biggs' unit...Quickly!

He then places Windy's arms behind his back and starts pressing on his chest
with sharp, rhythmic movements.  Han attaches new electrodes to the boy's
heart.  Windy again comes to, choking and coughing.  Finally, he begins to
cry.  The general takes the plastic tube from his mouth and tenderly pats him
on the back.

GENERAL
Let's get Biggs out of there.  He shouldn't be a problem.

131.  FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

Starkiller slams closed the hatch of Princess Leia's lifepod.  In the
distance, the subhuman cries of lonesome tree beasts cut through the forest
murmur.

ARTWO
Perhaps she went in search of us.

Starkiller studies the ground around the capsule.  There are a great many
footprints, and much broken foliage.

STARKILLER
Someone's got her.  She put up quite a fight...It's an easy trail to follow.

132.  VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN

Both Biggs and Windy are sleeping restlessly on the floor of the cave.  Han
watches over them as the general scans the valley below with a pair of
electrobinoculars.

THREEPIO
It's about fourteen degrees below the horizon... a little to the left.

The electrobinoculars sweep the rich green landscape until the come to rest on
a bright reflection, revealing some type of structure.

GENERAL
It's too small to be a military base...Could belong to a trapper.

THREEPIO
Highly unusual...

GENERAL
It's on the way.  Perhaps we should investigate.

Little Biggs wakes up with a giant yawn.

BIGGS
Hey!  Where are we?

133.  FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

The gargantuan trees are shrouded in mist, and the ominous sounds of unearthly
creatures fill the air.  Starkiller moves quietly and cautiously, followed by
Artwo, who inadvertently makes a loud clicking sound.  The young warrior
stops, and motions to the stubby little robot.

STARKILLER
Wait here.  If I don't return by zero two hundred, come looking for me.

The mechanical dwarf acknowledges with his computer light.  Starkiller moves
swiftly and silently forward, until he hears laughing and voices.  He climbs
up the bankside of a huge tree, and inches his way out onto one of the huge
overhanging branches.  Below him, he can see a group of scruffy, alien
trappers sitting around a nutron stove joking and telling stories.  Parked on
either side of the group are two large, tank-like "jungle crawlers."  Behind
the crawlers, five Wookees, (huge grey and furry beasts) hang upside down in a
tree.  Occasionally, they thrash about in great anger and frustration.

The trappers speak in a strange language, and although they appear slightly
human, they are slimy, deformed, hideous looking creatures.  Two of the
trappers yell at one another in a friendly argument.  One shirtless creature
goes into a "crawler," and the remaining eight laugh hysterically.  Starkiller
moves further out on the limb to get a better view.  A couple of pieces of
bark break loose, and float a hundred feet to the ground.  The trappers fail
to notice.  Moments later, the shirtless trapper emerges from the crawler with
Princess Leia held unconscious and half naked over his head.  Starkiller's
rage knows no bounds.  With a terrifying Jedi war cry, the young captain jumps
from the tree, sails over a hundred feet, and with great agility, lands in the
middle of the startled trappers.  In one continuous rapid motion, he ignites
his lasersword and cuts down three of the vile creatures.  The shirtless
trapper swings the princess over his shoulder, and runs back into the huge
"jungle crawler."  Two other trappers reach for their pistols, but the Jedi
has killed them before their weapons can clear leather.  The three remaining
creatures have their pistols out and start firing.  Explosions erupt all
around Starkiller.  One blast hits the branch holding the Wookees, and they
collapse with a loud screech in a heap.  One of the trappers is caught in the
crossfire and is blown apart.

When the smoke clears, Starkiller lies unconscious amid the burning rubble.
The jungle crawler begins to move out of the camp.  The last two trappers run
after it.  One is able to jump on board, but the second trapper runs too close
to the now freed Wookees.  Chewbacca, one of the furry giants, grabs him and
snaps him in two, like a stick of wood.  The jungle crawler disappears in the
forest mist.  The eight foot Chewbacca, who resembles a huge, grey bushbaby
with fierce baboon-like fangs, struggles to free his companions.

Starkiller regains semiconsciousness, and attempts to get up, only to groan
and collapse back into unconsciousness.  The Wookees gather around him and
poke him a couple times to see if he is still alive.  They squawk and jabber,
apparently in some kind of argument.  Finally, Dewanna, the largest of the
Wookees, picks up Starkiller and puts him over his shoulder.  The group
disappears into the jungle foliage.

134.  TREE HOUSE - FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

Han and Threepio carry the two little boys on their shoulders.  The general
stops on the edge of a clearing, and motions for the others to be still.
Biggs turns around, and signals his little brother to be quiet.  On the
opposite side of the clearing, a small metal structure is attached to one of
the huge trees.  It is a small, weatherbeaten hut of futuristic design.  It
appears deserted.  The general cautiously approaches the structure.

VOICE
Howdy stranger...What can I offer you?

The general spins around and sees Owen Lars, an aged and scruffy looking
anthropologist.

LARS (con't)
I'm Owen Lars of Bastine.

The general takes the old man's extended hand.

GENERAL
I'm Luke Skywalker of Aquilae.

He signals for the others to join him in the clearing.

135.  WOOKEE CAMP - YAVIN

The small caravan of Wookees, led by Chewbacca, enters a small clearing
surrounded by many bark and mud hovels.  Young Wookees race ahead of the group
yelling, and running in and out of the grubby little dwellings.  Giant,
bushbaby-like Wookees of all ages and sizes, make their way into the clearing.

Many stand dumbfounded, but others let out a joyful scream and rush up to
members of the group, hugging and kissing them.

Dewanna dumps the unconscious Starkiller on a raised area in the middle of the
clearing.  Armed Wookees immediately surround the helpless human.  Chewbacca
enters the largest of the lodges.  He is greeted by his father, Auzituck,
Chief of the Kaapauku tribe; an old and feeble Wookee dressed in royal skins
and headdress.

136.  INTERIOR - ANTHROPOLOGIST HUT - YAVIN

Anthropologist Lars, the general, Han and the children sit around a large
table eating.  Lars yells into the kitchen.

LARS
Beru!  Where's the thanta sauce?

Beru Lars, Owen's warm, plump wife, enters, carrying a small pitcher.  She
smiles at Owen.

BERU
I swan!  I put it right here in front, so you'd see it...(to Han)  Here's some
Bum Bum extract.  It's very mild...

LARS (to general)
There are no settlers to the south since the Dau family was wiped out... I'm
afraid I couldn't even get in there to bury them... Those Wookees are the
fiercest critters I've ever run across.  A new tribe moved in down there about
a year ago...and it's been hell ever since.  Only Yourellian trappers venture
in there now, and many of them don't even come back.

GENERAL
Where's the nearest city?

LARS
No cities at all...only a few scattered settlers and -- one Imperial
outpost... But the troops are of no help.  They kill and plunder rather than
protect...Enough...If your friends landed father south, I'd fear for them.

HAN
How far is the outpost from here?

LARS
Five leagues...an oppressive blight.

GENERAL
What class is it?  How many support craft?

LARS
It's very small, a class two....Only ten or twelve starraiders, I think.

Beru fusses over the boys, who refuse to eat their vegetables.  She makes up a
game, which tricks them into eating.  The general ponders the situation.  Han
eats, like he hasn't eaten in years.

137.  WOOKEE CAMP - AQUILAE [??  Yavin?]

Starkiller is surrounded by Wookees.  Young ones push through to get a better
look, as the adults jabber and argue about the human.  Starkiller regains
consciousness with a groan, and a sudden hush sweeps over the gathering.
Starkiller staggers to his feet, and the group of Wookees back away in mass.
The young Jedi surveys the situation for a few moments.  The Wookees appear to
be frightened of this brave warrior.  He reaches for his weapons, but they are
gone.  Three guards with long spears attempt to contain Starkiller.  With a
loud shout, he lunges at them, and they give him a little room.

Jommillia, a large, ferocious Wookee, steps forward.  He says something to the
guards, and they quickly move away.  He struts before Starkiller, boasting and
taunting him with his spear and battle ax.  The captain studies the Wookee
warrior as he paces back and forth, his helmet plumes dancing and chest armor
jangling.  Without warning, Starkiller lets out another loud yell, startling
Jommillia into backing off.  Starkiller continues his verbal assault, calling
the uncomprehending Wookee all manner of vile and degrading things.  Jommillia
continues to back into the surrounding crowd, momentarily confused by this odd
behaviour.  Slowly, Jommillia begins to grin.  He takes a defensive stance,
then begins to laugh hysterically.  This stops Starkiller.  The giant Wookee
swings his deadly, double-bladed battle ax over his head and expertly throws
it directly at the young captain's head.  To the amazement of Jommillia and
the other Wookees, Starkiller, with Jedi skill and concentration, catches the
ax in mid-air, then charges his furry opponent.

Jommillia is caught off-guard, but manages to block Starkiller's attack with
his spear.  The two warriors engage in a savage and fantastic duel.
Starkiller cuts the Wookee's spear in half, but is hit along the side of the
head by the shaft and is momentarily dazed.  The battle ax is knocked from his
hands.  He grabs the spear shaft and rams the giant creature in the belly.  A
loud command from outside the crowd stops the fight.  The Wookees part,
revealing Chewbacca and his father, who approach the two warriors.  Jommillia
bows before his chief, and is commanded to move away.  Chewbacca speaks to
Starkiller.  He doesn't understand, but welcomes the chance to catch his
breath.  Chewbacca then presents his father, who steps forward and bows before
the mighty Jedi.  Chewbacca bows also, as the crowd of Wookees chatter in
disbelief.  When the chief and his son rise, Starkiller bows down before them.

This pleases the Wookees, and they screech and cheer.

138.  TREE HOUSE - FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

Mr. and Mrs. Lars stand on the balcony of their tree house with Threepio and
the two little princes, Biggs, and Windy.  Han and the general emerge with
large survival backpacks and multiplelaser weapons.

GENERAL (to Threepio)
We'll call for you when we've found them.

THREEPIO
Your orders are quite clear.  The boys will be quite safe.

LARS
Don't worry.  The patrols never come out this far.  We'll take good care of
the boys.

GENERAL
Lars, your kindness will surely be rewarded.

LARS
Just be careful out there...

He pats Skywalker on the back as the old Jedi and the ever faithful Han
descend from the tree house.  [something whited out?]  At the base of the huge
tree, the warriors climb aboard two small rocket powered platforms.

LARS (yelling down to them)
They're pretty old.  I hope they'll be all right!

GENERAL
Out here, they're a wonderment.

Threepio and the kids wave as the jelsticks start with a whine.  They idle
about five feet above the ground.

LARS
Good hunting.  May the force of others be with you.

Han and the general wave as they ride off into the foreboding Yavin sunset.

139.  WOOKEE CAMP - YAVIN - NIGHT

A beautiful, but frenzied fire festival is underway.  Wookees perform the
Waita Tar dance, and yodel in a barking fashion around a large fire.  The
female Wookees arrive, carrying torches, and move in a circle around the
males.  The giant creatures are too involved to notice that little Artwo makes
his way around the dancers.  The stubby robot stops near one of the mud huts,
and looks around.  He then wobbles off toward the large chief's quarters, and
enters.

140.  WOOKEE CAMP - YAVIN - MORNING

Artwo exits the chief's hut and looks around.  It is a quiet, grey morning.  A
low mist hangs over the now deserted clearing.  He turns and signals back into
the hut.  Starkiller cautiously emerges from the mud house.  he wears a crude
backpack, and carries a large battle ax.  They start across the clearing.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, Chewbacca is standing before them.  He says nothing,
but scratches his head and then circles around Starkiller.

STARKILLER
We are leaving...We must go.  Stand away!

The huge Wookee kneels and bows down in front of the young Jedi.  Starkiller
looks down and smiles.

STARKILLER
Rise my friend.  We will meet again.

Starkiller walks toward the jungle and Chewbacca scurries ahead of him and
bows down once more.

ARTWO
What does he want?

Starkiller shakes his head, and rubs his several days growth of beard.  He
leans down toward Chewbacca.

STARKILLER
Stand up so we can talk properly.

Chewbacca jabbers in a [something whited out] questioning fashion.

STARKILLER
I am grateful to you and your people, but I must go.  I wish you understood
me.  It would make things so much easier.  Go!  Go!

Starkiller turns away, and begins to walk toward the jungle again.  Chewbacca
gets to his feet, and runs after the Jedi, following a few paces behind.
Starkiller notices the Wookee following them, and shakes his head.

141.  FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - TRAPPER SIGHT [sic] - YAVIN

The bodies of the killed trappers are covered with rat-sized insects.  A laser
explosion erupts in the middle of the slimy creatures and they scatter into
the underbrush.  Han and the general turn over one of the dead trappers.

HAN
They ran into something.

GENERAL
It's strange they left their dead.  Something...

The constant cacophony of jungle creatures suddenly stops.  The two warriors
scan the jungle for possible danger.  Han draws his laserpistol.  The
cacophony starts again, as the general ignites his lasersword.

HAN
Two or three moving this way, from the east.

He listens more closely for a few moments.

HAN (con't)
It's Artwo!

Starkiller and Artwo break out of the dark foliage into the clearing.  He
waves to Han and the general.  Artwo waddles a few paces behind.  Chewbacca
sees the humans and stops at the edge of the jungle.  He watches as Starkiller
and the general carry on an animated conversation.  Han sees the Wookee
lurking in the shadows.

HAN
You were followed.

STARKILLER
He wouldn't stay.  He's one of the ones I saved...

Han calls out to Chewbacca in the Wookee's own language, and the huge,
lumbering creature approaches the group.  Han and the Wookee talk for a few
moments, then embrace as if they were old friends.  Starkiller is surprised.

HAN (to Starkiller)
This is Chewbacca, son of Auzituck, Prince of the Sawas, a very powerful
tribe.  It seems they've made you a god.

The general smiles.  Starkiller is embarrassed.

142.  VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN

Starkiller joins the general on a ridge overlooking the Imperial outpost of
Mavassi.  All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing on a
small pedastal, jutting out above the dense jungle.

GENERAL
Their trail leads directly to the outpost.  Patrols are probably out looking
for us by now.

STARKILLER
Finding her in there isn't going to be easy.

GENERAL
Getting in there is going to be impossible.  We could sure use one of those
starships.

Starkiller spots something moving in the jungle.  He scans the area with his
electrobinoculars.

STARKILLER
Something's going on down there...Han!

Han moves up next to Starkiller, followed closely by Chewbacca.

STARKILLER
Your eyes are better than mine....What do you make of that?

HAN
They look like Wookees...hundreds of them.

Han turns and speaks to Chewbacca, gesturing toward the movement far below in
the jungle.

HAN
Apparently, it's a siege.  They've been harassing the outpost for almost two
years.

GENERAL
Have they ever tried to take the fortress?

Han relays this to Chewbacca.

HAN
He says they've made several assaults, but they are no match for the weapons.

GENERAL
It's only a class three fortress.  Maybe they just need a little help.

Starkiller grins, and Han says something to Chewbacca, who becomes excited and
screeches loudly.

143.  INTERIOR - TREEHOUSE - YAVIN

The incoming signal alarm on the anthropologist's radio system wails through
the calm of the tree house.  Biggs, dragging an eight-legged, furry rodent,
rushes up to the old radio and flips the receiver.

BIGGS
I'm reading yah.  Go ahead.

GENERAL
Biggs, how are you getting along?

BIGGS
Great!  I caught a thumper...a really big one.  Its name is "Amber."

He yanks on the leash, and the furry beast lets out a strained yelp.

GENERAL
Good, Biggs.  How's your brother?  Are you taking good care of him?

BIGGS
Oh, sure.  He's out collecting "Abas" with Owen and Beru.  I'm in charge here.

Did you find Leia?

GENERAL
Not yet.  We'll be away for a while.  You mind Lars until we return.  May the
force of others be with you.

BIGGS
All right.  Take care.

Threepio enters the room, carrying a plate of steaming food.  Biggs turns the
radio off, and puts the receiver away.  A crashing sound and voices are heard
in the clearing below.

THREEPIO
Come and eat your dinner.

BIGGS
They're back!  They're back!  Come Amber!

The furry rodent jumps up onto its eight stubby legs and rushes over to the
door, but stops short, and begins to growl.  Biggs stops behind the creature.

BIGGS
What is it, Amber?

Biggs peeks out the window, and sees a patrol of six Imperial stormtroopers
climbing out of an airtank.  He ducks back, and tugs Amber away from the door.

BIGGS
Quiet, Amber.  Come here.  Come on.

THREEPIO
What's wrong?

BIGGS
Troopers.  We must hide!  Stay quiet.

Biggs and the robot scramble for a trap door near a large shelf.  The troops
begin to climb the ladder to the tree house.  The trap door is heavy, and the
robot and the little boy struggle to get it open.  The troops break in the
door, just as Threepio closes the trap door.  The stormtroopers are led by a
rough looking sergeant.  They poke around, tearing everything apart.  Biggs
struggles to keep Amber quiet.  Suddenly he realizes something.

BIGGS
The food!

The sergeant takes the bowl of food from the table and studies it.  He then
takes a small chrome ball from his pocket, and tosses it into the air.
[something whited out?]  Antennae shoot from its surface as it floats around
the room.  Eventually, it hovers over the trap door.  A sinister grin sweeps
across the sergeant's face as he moves over to the trap door and puts the
chrome ball back into his pocket.

Threepio puts his arm around Biggs who is desperately clutching the struggling
thumper.  All the movement above them stops, and Biggs looks to the robot.

THREEPIO (quietly)
They're still up there.  Stay still.

The silence continues, then suddenly the trap door swings open with a loud
bang.  Amber breaks away from Biggs, and attacks the sergeant.  One of the
other troopers cuts the thumper in half with his lasersword.  The sergeant
pulls Biggs out of his hiding place.  Biggs stares at the dead thumper.

SERGEANT
Well, well, here's one of them, anyway.  Send seekers in all directions.  Find
the others!

144.  VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN

The general sits at the head of the large stone table, pushing small markers
around.  Han explains what the general is doing, to ten or fifteen Wookee
chiefs gathered around the table.  Occasionally, Chewbacca puts in a word of
further explanation or answers a question.  Starkiller sits back silently
watching the Wookee warriors and listens to the general's plan.

GENERAL
.... then they pull back to here.  That's where the trap will be set.  No-one
must advance.  An assault on the perimeter is useless.  Our only hope is to
use their weapons against them.

The general pauses, while Han and Chewbacca translate.

GENERAL (to Starkiller)
Once we acquire those tanks, our prime object must be to secure the starship.
No-one must escape.

145.  IMPERIAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

Three officers run along a row of giant air tnaks to a perimeter bunker.
There, two stormtroopers are watching the jungle.  When the officers arrive,
the troopers let them look through the powerful, mounted electrobinoculars.
One of the troopers points out several areas in the dense jungle.

146.  INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM - IMPERIAL OUTPOST - YAVIN

A trooper sitting at an elaborate control panel, turns to an officer watching
a monitor system.

TROOPER
A large concentration of trestuals at point E-2.

OFFICER
Alert squads one through six!

147.  VINE JUNGLES - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN

The general stands in a small clearing surrounded, by many armed Wookees
carrying large shiny shields.  Han moves back and forth, barking orders to the
assembled creatures.

GENERAL (to Han)
We're ready.  Give them the signal.

Han motions to a young Wookee, who takes off, running through the jungle.

148.  IMPERIAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

Three large air tanks slowly move toward the outpost perimeter.  The tank
pilots sit on the hatch rims of the ponderous weapons, studying the movements
of the Wookees.  The tank personnel talk to one another on an intercom system.

TANK PILOT
There is a large concentration....red two by C-3.  Let's break them up.

The pilots slip into the tanks and close the hatches.  The tanks open up with
a barrage of laser bolts which create a wall of explosions.  The Wookies
retreat, and the tanks follow.  The tank crews track the feeling creatures
with various electronic scopes, and laugh at the fleeing creatures.

149.  VINE JUNGLE - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN

The general stands on a limb of a jungle tree, watching the advancing tanks.
Starkiller is on another branch a few feet away.

GENERAL
They've grown sloppy fighting Wookees.  The intra-fazer systems aren't on.
They're in for a little surprise.

Starkiller flashes a signal mirror, which is received by a Wookee near the
tanks.  The Wookees are in pairs, and they hold heavy stone wedges attached to
woven vines; which in turn, are fastened high in the trees.  When the tanks
pass directly under the Wookees, they let loose with the heavy stone
pendulums.  The wedges fly through the air, neatly clipping off the antenna
groupings protruding from the tops of the air tanks.

150.  INTERIOR - AIR TANK - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

Several of the lights and monitors go dark on the main control panel.  The
pilot flips several switches in a panic.

PILOT
All high phasing units are out.  We've lost all contact....

SERGEANT
Send out a ground signal!

Suddenly, all of the monitors go white, and static fills the crowded tank
interior.  An alarm signal sounds.

SERGEANT
What is it?!!!

PILOT
All signals...sensers....everything is coming right back to us.  Some kind of
deflection screen.  It's a total blackout.

SERGEANT
Get out there and see if you can see anything.

The pilot pushes a button and the main hatch slowly slides away.

151.  VINE JUNGLE - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN

The pilot pops out of the hatch and sses two rows of Wookee warriors holding
reflective shields.  They form a circle that totally encompasses the massive
air tank.  Han shouts a signal to a group of Wookees in another tree, and they
cut loose a bent limb which is attached to a noose around the tank's hatch.
The noose instantly tightens around the pilot, and he is plucked from the tank
and suspended fifty feet in the air.  In an equally swift move, Starkiller
drops a small gas grenade into the open hatch.  It explodes and engulfs the
tank in a grey mist.

The Wookees let out a joyful yell, and charge the tank.  Han yells at them to
stop, but several make it to the conquered craft before the gas cloud
dissipates and they are felled by the fumes.  Starkiller shakes his head, then
after the smoke clears, jumps on the back of the immobile tank.

Several signal mirrors flash their messages to Han and the general.

HAN
That makes four captured.

GENERAL
Have them camouflaged.  I'm going with Starkiller.

152.  INTERIOR - AIR-TANK - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

Wookees are removing the tank crew as Starkiller checks out the power
controls.  The general slides through the main hatch.

GENERAL
Any damage?

STARKILLER
She's fine...We're ready to move.

GENERAL
Then let's go...

The general yells for the Wookees to clear the tanks, and they scramble out of
the hatch.

153.  VINE JUNGLE - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN

The tank starts up with a loud roar, startling the many Wookees resting on the
mighty vehicle.  Chewbacca yells at the warriors and they fall a few feet
behind the tank, their shields forming a shiny protective wall.

154.  IMPERIAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

Several officers stand on a parked air-tank trying to get a better view of the
operation.  A light landspeeder pulls up next to the group, and a general gets
out.  The officers snap to attention.

GENERAL
Can you see anything?

OFFICER
No Sir, but they've stopped firing.

AID [sic]
Communications still can't reach them, Sir.

GENERAL
Nobody seems to know what's going on.

OFFICER
I'm sure they've got them on the run, Sir.

A laserbolt flashes out of the jungle and knocks out a guard tower about a
quarter of a mile from where the men are standing.  Seconds later, the air-
tank on which they are standing explodes into a million pieces.  Out of the
jungle, rumbles the captured air-tank, driven by Starkiller and followed by a
column of Wookee warriors.

Alarms sound, troops rush from the low block houses, and a battle rages inside
the outpost.  Wookees with spears, axes, and arrows, manage to hold their own
against the laser weapons of the stormtroopers.  Explosions erupt everywhere,
as the Wookees begin to use captured laserrifles.  They are much fiercer
fighters than the soft Imperial troops.

155.  INTERIOR - AIR-TANK - OUTPOST - YAVIN

Starkiller works the controls of the air-tank as the general watches the
monitors, and works the laserguns.

GENERAL
Swing left.  They're trying to cut us off.

156.  STARSHIP RUNWAY - IMPERIAL OUTPOST - YAVIN

Starkiller maneuvers the air-tank in front of a line of ten starships, cutting
off a platoon of stormtroopers.  The troops open fire on the tank, but are cut
down by a group of Wookees who have moved in behind them.  Han and Artwo run
up to the tank as Starkiller and the general climb out of the hatch.

HAN
We've taken the main control center.  All power units have been shut down.
They're helpless.

STARKILLER
Have they found Leia?

HAN
They've taken her back to Aquilae.  The ship left not more than ten hours ago.

GENERAL (to Han)
Set up a perimeter around these starships...Use as many men as you need.

157.  STAFF OFFICE - IMPERIAL OUTPOST - YAVIN

Starkiller and the general sit at a large table in the deserted office of the
Imperial Chief of Staff.  The room is in a state of disarray; papers are
scattered everywhere.  Artwo stands on a chair, projecting an image of the
"death star" fortress orbiting Aquilae, on the table top.

ARTWO
....And are connected to the central system by a series of crossing networks
similar to section TB4 or F687.

The projection switches to a close-up view of the transformer.  The general
studies it carefully, then leans back in his chair.  Artwo turns off the
projector.

GENERAL
I'm not going to stop you, but I think it's a reckless move.  Even if you
could get in, you'd never be able to get out... Just be patient.  We now have
enough ships to attack in force.

STARKILLER
But no pilots...

Han and Chewbacca enter the office.

HAN
Still no contact with Owen Lars or the kids...I'm afraid something's happened.

GENERAL
Have Chewbacca send two of his best warriors out there to get them.

Han relates this to Chewbacca.  The general turns back to Starkiller, who
watches Chewbacca leave the room.

STARKILLER (mocking)
They're fierce warriors, but you'll never teach them to fly.

The general gives him a stern look.

GENERAL
They'll fly, and Aquilae will be free.

STARKILLER
May the force of others be with you.

The general embraces the young Jedi.

GENERAL
Bring her back safely.

158.  OUTPOST RUNWAY - STARSHIP - YAVIN

Starkiller, dressed as an Imperial skyraider, and Artwo climb aboard one of
the giant four-man starships.  A crowd of Wookees, lead by Chewbacca, give a
rousing cheer for the departing Jedi.  Starkiller breaks into a smile and
waves to the joyous warriors.  The general watches the proceedings from a
bunker turret.  He is lost in thought.

159.  SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Three Imperial space transports dock inside the huge artificial moon.  Two
smaller convoy starships circle the larger craft until the three ships are
safely inside the vast fortress.

160.  CONFERENCE ROOM - INTERIOR SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

General Vader of the Imperial Space Fleet, hurries down a hallway, followed by
a group of officers.  They enter the large conference room where Leia is held
under heavy squad.  She appears well, but saddened.  Vader approaches her and
bows  before her.

VADER
I pray you have been treated honorably?  I am your servant, Darth Vader.  It
won't be long before we will be able to return you to your people.  (to an
aide)  Are the chambers ready?

AIDE
They are working on it, Sir.

Leia stares defiantly at him.  She starts to speak, but a powerful electric
shock engulfs her body, and she whines in extreme pain.

VADER
Just relax, and everything will be fine.  (to guards)  Take her to section
twenty-five.

Leia is forcibly taken from the room.

VADER (to officer)
What time do the doctors from Alderaan arrive?

OFFICER
Sixty-five hours, Sir.

VADER
Put all security stations on alert until they arrive.

The officer salutes smartly, and exits.

161.  IMPERIAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

A huge air tank rumbles along the approach to the Imperial outpost.  The pilot
sits on the main hatch of the tank, talking to his crew, by headphones.

PILOT
Any contact yet?... It appears deserted...I don't like it.

The tank enters the outpost perimeter and smoking rubble from the recent
battle comes into view.  The pilot becomes alarmed.

PILOT
There has been an attack!  Reverse direction.

The tank comes to a grinding halt, but before it can start up again, it is
surrounded by the Wookee army.  From out of nowhere, a Wookee is on the back
of the air-tank and has the pilot in a powerful armlock.

A Wookee chieftain rushes from a bunker, followed by an excited, jabbering
warrior.  They reach the captured air-tank just as the last crewman is hauled
out, and little Biggs pokes his head out of the hatch.  He is frightened.  His
younger brother, Windy, follows him out of the tank.  Below them, the Wookees
bully the captured crewmen.

WINDY
What will they do to us?

BIGGS
I don't know, but it don't look good.

Threepio pulls himself out of the air-tank, followed by Owen Lars and his
wife.  The Wookee chieftain climbs on board, and starts to jabber at the
group.  The Wookee carries on for some time, gesturing wildly, and continually
pointing at the sky.  The two boys are too scared to say anything.  Finally,
the Wookee kneels before them.  Threepio politely returns a short bow.

BIGGS
I don't get it.

The Wookee rises and again gestures skyward, just then a starship wildly
buzzes the field, upsidedown.  All the Wookees run for cover.  The chief
Wookee points to the crafts, and jabbers incessantly.

162.  INTERIOR - IMPERIAL STARSHIP - SKY OVER YAVIN

Chewbacca sits at the controls of a four-man starship.  His face is a twisted
combination of complete panic and an awesome religious experience.  The
general, sitting next to him, calmly switches a few buttons on the control
panel, as Han watches from the seat directly behind the Wookee.

GENERAL
You'll get the hang of it.

Han also gives the Wookee a few words of encouragement.

GENERAL
Now, let's see if we can get into orbit...Push this, then ease her up.

Chewbacca follows the instructions, but pulls back on the lever too fast and
the ships begins to vibrate and bounce violently.  Chewbacca thinks it's
funny, and begins to laugh hysterically.  Han becomes nervous and quiet.

GENERAL
Not so fast - Back off!  Back off!

Han yells at the Wookee, who can't respond because he is laughing so hard.
The general pulls back on the lever.  Han shakes his head, and gives the
general a worried look.

GENERAL
Don't worry.  Ignorance is on their side.

Han is beginning to look a little sick.  He gets up and rushes to the back of
the ship.

163.  IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS - DOCKING AREA - AQUILAE

The canopy on the starship pops open, and Artwo and the young Jedi, disguised
as a starraider, climb out onto the docking platform.  An officer and two
groundcrew approach him and salute.  Starkiller hands him his papers.

STARKILLER
I'm here to check the vent ports in the rim tracks.

OFFICER
Your ship is from Yavin... We've lost all contact with them.  What's going on
out there?

STARKILLER
There is a fierce inversion just east of Bull Pup station... It's really a
mess out there.

The officer smiles and the ground crew starts to check out the starship.
Starkiller heads for the main docking exit, followed by Artwo.  He remembers
something as he passes the control station, and calls out to the officer.

STARKILLER
Do you mind if I use your com-link?

OFFICER
No.  Go ahead.

Starkiller walks into the small control area and pretends to talk on an
intercom system.

STARKILLER (to Artwo)
Find the highest security area.

Artwo punches his claw arm into a computer socket, and the brain comes to
life, feeding information to the little robot.

Starkiller watches the officer as he directs the crewmen in the securing of
the starship.  Artwo removes his arm from the computer, and the duo leave the
control station.

ARTWO
Station 325 is the highest security area on board.  It's a detention area.

They disappear into a chamber lock hallway.

164.  ELEVATOR TUBE - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Starkiller, trying to look inconspicuous, waits for a horizontal elevator.
Troops and fortress personnel come and go, but no-one seems to pay any
attention to the pair.  Finally a small car arrives, and Starkiller follows
Artwo into the podlike vehicle, and it takes off through a vacuum tunnel.

165.  DETENTION AREA - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Starkiller and Artwo enter a security station.  Guards and electronic cutters
are everywhere.  An officer approaches Starkiller, and checks his papers.

OFFICER
The B-23 can't enter this station.

STARKILLER
But I need him.

OFFICER
Sorry.  No mechanical personnel.  It's restricted.

Starkiller watches helplessly, as Artwo is led into a waiting area.

OFFICER
You may proceed, but you'll have to be escorted.

A trooper joins Starkiller and leads him through a series of hallways.
Starkiller carefully surveys the area as he follows the guard.

TROOPER
Mathusians just beat the PDR's again.  They should be in another league.  Do
you follow the ecometrics?

The guard turns to discover that Starkiller has disappeared.  He is stunned,
then manages to pull out a small ring radio.

TROOPER
Code six - Alert.

166.  STARSHIP RUNWAY - IMPERIAL OUTPOST - YAVIN

Six Wookees sit before Han and the general, listening to Han explain something
about space fighting.  Owen Lars approaches the general.

LARS
We've made contact with the underground on Aquilae.  Things are tighter.  They
can only get one man out.  Datos is on his way.

GENERAL
We should be ready by the time he arrives.

Han turns to the general.

HAN
They're ready to go up.

The general makes a short statement to the Wookes in their own language.  They
let out a loud cheer, and run for the row of starships.

167.  STARSHIP - SPACE - YAVIN

The general sits next to Chewbacca, as he leads two other Wookee piloted
starships in a tight formation.  They head for a small cluster of asteroids
orbiting near the planet's surface.  The general quietly gives Chewbacca some
reassuring instructions.  Han leads a second formation of three ships,
following Chewbacca's group.  The two formations of starships make an attack
run on the asteroids.  The general watches as Chewbacca lines up and fires at
an asteroid blowing it into a million pieces.  The general smiles, and slaps
Chewbacca on the back.  The Wookees excitedly chatter among themselves over
the intercom system.

168.  DETENTION AREA HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

A patrol of ten men marches through one of the long hallways in the detention
area.  They stop at an intersection.  The officer in charge reports on the
intercom.

OFFICER
Ben Five to Moma.  All clear.

The troops relax, some stand in groups, others wander a distance away, poking
into the various small alleyways running off the main hallway.  One trooper
notices a small reflected light in one of the narrow corridors, and carefully
moves down the dark passageway to check it out.  Out of no-where, a fist
knocks the trooper unconscious and drags him into a small alcove.

The officer finishes his report on the intercom and yells for the troops to
fall-in.  Men scurry in all directions and out of a narrow corridor emerges
Starkiller, dressed in the uniform of an Imperial startrooper.  He joins the
platoon, and they march away.

169.  GENERAL'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

General Vader and several officers watch the progress of the search on TV
monitors.  The general speaks into an intercom.

VADER
Have them clear the area.  Bring in the seekers.

On the monitors, the troops are assembled in the main entry-way and several
small chrome balls are thrown into the hallway.  Small antennae pop from the
chrome surface, and the small balls float down the hallways.  Valorum, once a
proud Knight of the Sith, enters wearing the uniform of a stormtrooper.  He
snaps to attention before the general, and hands him a report.  Vader gives
Valorum a sly grin.

VALORUM
Contact has been lost with the ship carrying the doctors from Alderaan.  The
princess' treatment will have to be delayed.

VADER
We've just trapped your own friend Starkiller.  Watch us accomplish what you
found to be impossible.

Valorum is humiliated, but stays at attention.  Valorum [Vader?] gets an
emergency call on the intercom.

VADER
Yes...Yes... Put it on the view screen.

One of the TV monitors switches to an image of the unconscious trooper
Starkiller stripped.

VADER
Get me the Captain of the Guard.

170.  DETENTION AREA - MAIN ENTRY - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Three squads of troops including Starkiller, stand at attention in the main
entrance to the detention center, while the Captain of the Guard gets new
orders over his headphones.  Starkiller studies the situation carefully,
looking for a way out of his predicament.  The Captain of the Guard calls up
the platoon sergeants and gives them a series of orders.  They return to their
squads and begin to inspect the troops.  Starkiller begins to get worried.

The sergeant works his way down the line until he gets to the trooper next to
Starkiller.  He sees no chance of escape, but surprise.  Suddenly, he bolts
from the ranks and races down the hallway.

CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD
Squad leaders!

Ten troopers break out of the ranks and take up the chase.  Starkiller runs
down a corridor and rounds a corner, reaching a dead end.  The troops round
the corner and confront the trapped Jedi.  The sound of igniting laserswords
fills the hallway.  Starkiller takes a defensive stance, his huge lasersword
buzzing loudly.  The troops attack.  They fight with skill and bravery, but
are eventually all cut down by the invincible Jedi warrior.

Starkiller breaks away from the troops and runs down a long hallway.  A safety
door slides shut, closing off his escape.  He turns around in time to see
another door seal off the opposite end of the hallway.  Before he can make any
attempt to pry open the door, gas fills the sealed corridor.  Starkiller
collapses in a heap on the floor.

171.  GENERAL'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Vader laughs as he watches the unconscious Starkiller on the TV monitors.  All
of the other officers in the room are [something whited out] laughing and
joking, except Valorum, who remains grimly at attention.

GENERAL (to Valorum)
Take him to the special section.

Valorum salutes, and exits the offices.  Vader laughs again.

172.  STARSHIP RUNWAY - IMPERIAL OUTPOST - YAVIN

Nine gleaming starships sit in a row along the edge of the vast jungle runway.

Bizarre and colorful Wookee designs have been painted across the large
deflector fins of the spacecraft.  Some designs transform the ships into huge
and grotesque animals, while others create unique mosaic patterns.  The four-
man Wookee crews stand proudly at attention in front of their ships.  The
general, along with Han and the underground leader, Datos, review the
assembled Wookees.

In one of the Wookee crews, a pilot is picking fleas off the back of his tail
gunner.  When the general passes, he snaps to attention.  There is a gleam in
the general's eye as he shows off his strike force to the crusty old
underground leader.  When they've inspected the last starship, Datos turns to
the general.

DATOS
I'm speechless.  It's amazing.  A most impressive display.  For the first time
since the take-over, I feel real hope.

GENERAL
Will your people be ready?

DATOS
Our forces have already started sabotaging their com-link set ups.  A refugee
camp on Mananyo has been conducting raids on shipping from Alderaan.  That's
how we intercepted those doctors...

GENERAL (to Han)
Get them in the ships... We're on our way.  (to Datos)  Send the code signal.

173.  DETENTION CELL - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

General Vader and Valorum watch as a medic revives Starkiller, who has been
strapped to an upright slab, protected by cutter-rays.

MEDIC
He's coming round.

The medic backs away, and throws the switch which activates the cutters.  A
blue glow surrounds Starkiller as he wakes up and sees Vader and Valorum.

VADER
For all the myths and the trouble, you don't seem like much...

He laughs and leaves Valorum alone in the room with the young Jedi.  Valorum
appears sad and frustrated at the capture of the noble warrior.  They stare at
one another for a few moments.

VALORUM
You were insane to come here.  The security on this... this thing is
impossible.  Why?....For her?  I can't believe your loyalty is that strong.
You're a great warrior... but you're a greater fool.  This is a place for
androids, no codes, no honor.  Our ways are useless here.  Why couldn't you
have stayed away?

He storms out of the cell.  Starkiller struggles to free himself.

174.  SLUM DWELLING - GORDON SPACEPORT - AQUILAE

The young partisan, Occo, listens to a small transmitter in a secret closet
behind the main room in a slum dwelling.  He jumps up and runs into the main
room, where Quist and several other men are sitting around a table covered
with maps and plans.

OCCO
It's Datos.  We've got the go ahead.

Everyone cheers and starts hugging and slapping each other on the back.
Finally, they settle down.

QUIST
Go to your organizations.  (to Occo)  What's the code time?

OCCO
Zero three thirty...

QUIST
May the force of others be with you.

The men solemnly shake hands and leave the room.

175.  GOVERNOR'S OFFICE - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Starkiller stands on a small platform before Governor Hoedaack and the High
Consul.  His hands are held behind his back by electric bonds.

GOVERNOR
.... And I'm sure the emperor will enjoy your execution.  I only regret I
won't be there myself.  This should end the Jedi myth once and for all.  Take
him to Alderaan.

Valorum steps forward with a squad of stormtroopers and escorts the prisoner
away.  Vader and the governor seem very pleased with themselves.  Valorum
looks back in disgust.

176.  CONTROL CENTER - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

In the large central control room, two officers sit above a row of monitors
and giant read-outs.

FIRST OFFICER
Look!  That whole sector just went dead.  We're losing contact with the
surface.  Use the IF link and find out what's going on.

177.  DOCKING AREA - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Valorum halts the squad guarding Starkiller on an observation deck overlooking
a starship docking port.  Valorum reports to the officer in charge.

VALORUM
Where is the ship?

OFFICER
It's on its way in.  It will just be a few minutes.

Valorum returns to his squad and watches the large starship slowly move into
the docking area.  He glances at Starkiller, who stands defiant, ready to meet
his fate.

Valorum continues to study Starkiller.  The young Jedi returns his gaze.
Slowly, the spacecraft locks onto the docking port with a loud jolt.  The
troops snap to attention, but Valorum grabs two laserswords and in one swift
move, switches off Starkiller's bonds and tosses him one of the laserswords.
Starkiller assumes a defensive stance, as the troops realize what has happened
and draw their swords.

VALORUM
This way!

The two warriors fight their way through a side exit.  The door slides closed
behind them, and Valorum throws the lock, trapping the troops on the
observation platform.  They race down the hallway and stop at an intersection.

VALORUM
This way!  We can get a starship and be out of here before they've
discovered...

STARKILLER
I'm not leaving without the princess.

VALORUM
It's impossible; there are traps everywhere... You're mad!

Starkiller just grins and runs down the passageway leading to the detention
area.  Valorum rushes and catches up.  An alarm signal wails through the
hallways.

178.  WOOKEE STARSHIPS - SPACE

The general leads three squads, of three starships each toward the glowing
planet of Aquilae.

GENERAL
There she is.  Activate your deflection shields.

179.  DETENTION AREA - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Valorum talks with the Captain of the Guard.  He gestures wildly, like
something important had happened.  Four troops run into the central detention
area leading the bound Princess Leia.  The Captain of the Guard salutes
Valorum, and the Sith knight, followed by the four troops and Leia, leave the
main area.

180.  DETENTION HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Starkiller appears boldly at the end of the hallway, facing Valorum and the
troops.

VALORUM
Get him!

The troops rush for Starkiller, swords drawn.  They are no match for the
skilled Jedi.  He makes short work of them, as Valorum frees the princess.
The trio then run into another hallway.  The princess embraces Starkiller.

VALORUM
We only have a few seconds before they find us.  All of these hallways are
sealable...

Starkiller spots a small garbage chute on the corridor wall.  He goes and
looks into it.

STARKILLER
Is this pressurized?

Valorum nods yes, and they lift the princess into the chute and quickly
follow.

181.  GARBAGE CHUTE - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The trio slides through a series of chutes, until they end up in a large room
full of garbage.  Starkiller spots a doorway and struggles to get it open.

VALORUM
They're power sealed...We'll have to find another way, or some way to shut the
power off...

They search the smooth-walled room for another exit.

182.  GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Governor Hoedaack watches General Vader as he supervises the hunt for
Starkiller and Valorum.  They watch troops move through the detention area via
TV monitors.  Seekers buzz through the hallways.  The general gets a report
from an officer on another monitor.

OFFICER
We've lost contact with the surface.  There is a good probability of an
uprising.  Even the IF links are out.

GENERAL
Use a substandard relay and put all units on alert.

The officer disappears from the monitor and is replaced with the Captain of
the Guard.

CAPTAIN
All sections D through P-12 are clear.  We have reason to suspect they escaped
through the disposal system.  We are checking....(he is interrupted by an
excited trooper who tells him something)....We've found them in Receptacle B-
29.  You should....

A red light flashes on one of the other monitors.

GENERAL
Hold on...

A controller appears on the second monitor.

CONTROLLER
Starships approaching, three squads.  Imperial design, but no clearance...

GENERAL
Full alert.  Battle stations....

The general turns back to the Captain of the Guards.

CAPTAIN
You should have them on your screen.

Alarms sound throughout the fortress.  Lights flash a warning.

182.  [obviously an oversight - second 182] GARBAGE RECEPTACLE - SPACE
FORTRESS - AQUILAE

A floodlight switches on, revealing Valorum and Starkiller attempting to cut
open the door.  The princess stands up and stares into the floodlight.
Vader's voice comes over an intercom.

VADER
I'm afraid I have no more time to deal with you.  A senseless and futile
attack by your friends has forced me to take a rather unpleasant course of
action.  Your execution will have to be expedited.

The intercom clicks off, and a loud rumbling begins to shake the room.  With a
loud shriek, the princess points to the far wall; which starts to move toward
the trio.  The situation looks desperate.

183.  SPACE - WOOKEE STARSHIPS - AQUILAE

Laserfire from the space fortress creates a wall of death, which the three
squadrons of Wookee starships miraculously emerge through undamaged.  The
general barks orders to the Wookee craft, and Chewbacca and his squadron break
off and start an attack dive.  Laser fire from Chewbacca's brightly colored
ship hits one of the prime power terminals on the fortress surface.  It
explodes, creating weird electric arcs, as it goes.

Han and the general also concentrate fire on the distinctive black power
terminals.  Two more are destroyed in an arcing spectacle.  A chain reaction
is set off, creating a series of explosions leaping across the surface of the
fortress from power terminal to power terminal.

184.  GARBAGE RECEPTACLE - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The shock of the explosion can be felt over the rumbling of the trash masher.
The wall has moved within a few yards of squashing Valorum, Starkiller and the
princess.  They are still frantically trying to somehow stop the relentless
wall, to no avail.  The lights blink off, then on again, and the moving wall
rumbles to a halt.  Leia breathes a sigh of relief.

STARKILLER
They must have knocked the power out.

Valorum runs over to the door, and kicks it open.  They rush out of the would-
be death trap.

185.  SPACE - WOOKEE STARSHIPS - AQUILAE

One of the Wookee starships is caught in a crossfire and disappears in a cloud
of smoke.  Another ship for some unknown reason dives headlong into the
surface of the fortress, creating a huge explosion.

186.  MAIN HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Starkiller, Valorum, and the princess are thrown to a hallway floor by the
explosion.  They get up and start down the hallway again.  A voice calls out
from a connecting corridor.

ARTWO
Hey!  Over here.

The trio turns and see little Artwo standing at the other end of the corridor.

He waves his claw arm at them, and wobbles toward them.

ARTWO
The power core has exceeded the normal stress quotient by point eight.  The
magnetic fusion pods have evaporated.  There appears to be an immediate
danger.

VALORUM
There is a lifepod station at the other end of this sector... Hurry.

The group, followed by Artwo, make a dash for the lifepod, but are knocked to
the ground by another explosion, which rocks the hallway.  A hole is ripped in
one wall, sucking debris into space.  Everyone holds on to wall fixtures for
dear life.

187.  GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

Aides and officers rush through the office, as Vader tries to keep things
under control.  Governor Hoedaack remains calm, watching the progress of the
battle.  Vader turns to the governor.

VADER
They've pinpointed every terminal.  It's impossible.  What are they?  Where
did they come from?  An electromagnetic transfer has started....There's no
stopping it...

GOVERNOR
Continue the fight...

VADER
We've already lost control of the planet.  We must abandon ship while there is
still time...Conditions are much worse than...

GOVERNOR
Continue the fight...This fortress is invincible.  I will not give up.

A giant explosion sweeps through the office.

188.  SPACE - WOOKEE STARSHIPS

The tiny starships race the chain reaction explosions across the surface of
the fortress.  Laserfire is everywhere.  one of the starships skimming across
the surface, lags behind and is caught in an explosion and disappears.

GENERAL
Han!  Get everyone out of there.  The whole thing's going to go....Return to
Gordon... Get them out.

Han relays the order to the Wookees, and then starships pull away from the
crippled fortress.

189.  MAIN HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - AQUILAE

The group has made its way past the hole in the wall and is climbing into the
lifepods.  Starkiller helps the princess into one, while Valorum and Artwo get
into the other.  Warning sirens scream throughout the hallways.  Three troops
run toward the lifepods, firing laserpistols.  Valorum returns the fire,
stopping the oncoming troops.  Hatches are closed, and the lifepods eject into
space.

190.  LIFEPODS - SPACE - YAVIN ORBIT

The two lifepods drift toward the calm of the planet's surface.  Starkiller
and the princess embrace, and he kisses her tenderly.  They watch the ominous
fortress grow smaller and smaller as they drift away.  Suddenly, a great flash
replaces the fortress and rubble streaks past the lifepods.  Several giant
explosions follow, then there is only a smoke cloud where the mighty fortress
once orbited Aquilae.

191.  THRONE ROOM - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE

Queen Leia, in all her grandeur, sits on the magnificent throne of Aquilae.
Starkiller and the general stand to her right.  Several old advisors stand to
her left.  Han presents Chewbacca and a delegation of Wookees with a treaty,
gifts, and a medal of honor.  They bow and exit.  Han moves to one side of the
crowded court.  Valorum stands next to him.  They watch as the two robots,
Artwo and Threepio, approach the queen, and bow.

QUEEN
Your service to Aquilae is greatly appreciated.  You are designated class A-4,
and will serve Annikin Starkiller, the new Lord Protector of Aquilae.  Rise!

The robots rise and exit through the long entrance hall to the throne.  The
queen turns and smiles at Starkiller and the general.  The general and
Starkiller salute their new queen.

FADE OUT

The present tense is more common in writing. As you can see by all the explanations I am giving, they are all written in the present tense. That is because it is instructional. Instructional writing is more commonly written in present tense. However, stories in novels are written in past tense.

The ministers of foreign affairs of the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, France, China, the European Union and Iran negotiating in Lausanne for a Comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme (30 March 2015).

Negotiation is a dialogue between two or more people or parties intended to reach a beneficial outcome over one or more issues where a conflict exists with respect to at least one of these issues. Negotiation is an interaction and process between entities who compromise to agree on matters of mutual interest, while optimizing their individual utilities.[1] This beneficial outcome can be for all of the parties involved, or just for one or some of them. Negotiators need to understand negotiation process and other negotiators to increase their chances to close deals, avoid conflicts, establishing relationship with other parties and gain profit.[1]

It is aimed to resolve points of difference, to gain advantage for an individual or collective, or to craft outcomes to satisfy various interests. It is often conducted by putting forward a position and making concessions to achieve an agreement. The degree to which the negotiating parties trust each other to implement the negotiated solution is a major factor in determining whether negotiations are successful.

People negotiate daily, often without considering it a negotiation.[2][3][page needed] Negotiation occurs in organizations, including businesses, non-profits, and within and between governments as well as in sales and legal proceedings, and in personal situations such as marriage, divorce, parenting, etc. Professional negotiators are often specialized, such as union negotiators, leverage buyout negotiators, peace negotiator, or hostage negotiators. They may also work under other titles, such as diplomats, legislators, or brokers. There is also negotiation conducted by algorithms or machines known as autonomous negotiation.[4][1][5] For automation, the negotiation participants and process have to be modeled correctly.[6]

Types

Negotiation can take a wide variety of forms, from a multilateral conference of all United Nations members to establish a new international norm (such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) to a meeting of parties to a conflict to end violence or resolve the underlying issue (such as constitutional negotiations in South Africa in 1990-1994 or in Colombia with the FARC in 2012-2015) to a business encounter to make a deal to a face-off between parents (or between parent and child) over the child's proper behavior.[7] Mediation is a form of negotiation with a third-party catalyst who helps the conflicting parties negotiate when they cannot do so by themselves. Negotiation can be contrasted with arbitration, where the decision lies with the third party, which the conflicting parties are committed to accept.

Negotiation theorists generally distinguish between two types of negotiation[8] The difference in the usage of the two type depends on the mindset of the negotiator but also on the situation: one-off encounters where lasting relationships do not obtain are more likely to produce distributive negotiations whereas lasting relationships are more likely to require integrative negotiating[9] Different theorists use different labels for the two general types and distinguish them in different ways.
Distributive negotiation
See also: Zero-sum game

Distributive negotiation is also sometimes called positional or hard-bargaining negotiation and attempts to distribute a "fixed pie" of benefits. Distributive negotiation operates under zero-sum conditions and implies that any gain one party makes is at the expense of the other and vice versa. For this reason, distributive negotiation is also sometimes called win-lose because of the assumption that one person's gain is another person's loss. Distributive negotiation examples include haggling prices on an open market, including the negotiation of the price of a car or a home.

In a distributive negotiation, each side often adopts an extreme or fixed position, knowing it will not be accepted—and then seeks to cede as little as possible before reaching a deal. Distributive bargainers conceive of negotiation as a process of distributing a fixed amount of value. A distributive negotiation often involves people who have never had a previous interactive relationship, nor are they likely to do so again in the near future, although all negotiations usually have a distributive element.

In the distributive approach each negotiator fights for the largest possible piece of the pie, so parties tend to regard each other more as an adversary than a partner and to take a harder line.[10] Since Prospect Theory indicates that people value losses more than gains and are more risk-averse about losses, concession-convergence bargaining is likely to be more acrimonious and less productive of an agreement[11]
Integrative negotiation
See also: Non-zero-sum game and Win-win game

Integrative negotiation is also called interest-based, merit-based, or principled negotiation. It is a set of techniques that attempts to improve the quality and likelihood of negotiated agreement by taking advantage of the fact that different parties often value various outcomes differently.[12] While distributive negotiation assumes there is a fixed amount of value (a "fixed pie") to be divided between the parties, integrative negotiation attempts to create value in the course of the negotiation ("expand the pie") by either "compensating" loss of one item with gains from another ("trade-offs" or logrolling), or by constructing or reframing the issues of the conflict in such a way that both parties benefit ("win-win" negotiation).[13]

However, even integrative negotiation is likely to have some distributive elements, especially when the different parties both value different items to the same degree or when details are left to be allocated at the end of the negotiation. While concession is mandatory for negotiations, research shows that people who concede more quickly, are less likely to explore all integrative and mutually beneficial solutions. Therefore, early conceding reduces the chance of an integrative negotiation.[14]

Integrative negotiation often involves a higher degree of trust and the formation of a relationship. It can also involve creative problem-solving that aims to achieve mutual gains. It sees a good agreement as not one with maximum individual gain, but one that provides optimum gain for all parties. Gains in this scenario are not at the expense of the Other, but with it. Each seeks to accord the Other enough benefit that it will hold to the agreement that gives the first party an agreeable outcome, and vice versa.

Productive negotiation focuses on the underlying interests of the parties rather than their starting positions, approaches negotiation as a shared problem-solving rather than a personalized battle, and insists upon adherence to objective, principled criteria as the basis for agreement.[15]
Stages in the negotiation process

However, negotiators need not sacrifice effective negotiation in favor of a positive relationship between parties. Rather than conceding, each side can appreciate that the other has emotions and motivations of their own and use this to their advantage in discussing the issue. In fact, perspective-taking can help move parties toward a more integrative solution. Fisher et al. illustrate a few techniques that effectively improve perspective-taking in their book Getting to Yes, and through the following, negotiators can separate people from the problem itself.

    Put yourself in their shoes – People tend to search for information that confirms his or her own beliefs and often ignore information that contradicts prior beliefs. In order to negotiate effectively, it is important to empathize with the other party's point of view. One should be open to other views and attempt to approach an issue from the perspective of the other.
    Discuss each other's perceptions – A more direct approach to understanding the other party is to explicitly discuss each other's perceptions. Each individual should openly and honestly share his or her perceptions without assigning blame or judgement to the other.
    Find opportunities to act inconsistently with his or her views – It is possible that the other party has prior perceptions and expectations about the other side. The other side can act in a way that directly contradicts those preconceptions, which can effectively send a message that the party is interested in an integrative negotiation.
    Face-saving – This approach refers to justifying a stance based on one's previously expressed principles and values in a negotiation. This approach to an issue is less arbitrary, and thus, it is more understandable from the opposing party's perspective.[16]

Additionally, negotiators can use certain communication techniques to build a stronger relationship and develop more meaningful negotiation solution.

    Active listening – Listening is more than just hearing what the other side is saying. Active listening involves paying close attention to what is being said verbally and nonverbally. It involves periodically seeking further clarification from the person. By asking the person exactly what they mean, they may realize you are not simply walking through a routine, but rather take them seriously.
    Speak for a purpose – Too much information can be as harmful as too little. Before stating an important point, determine exactly what you wish you communicate to the other party. Determine the exact purpose that this shared information will serve.[16]

Integrated negotiation

Integrated negotiation is a strategic approach to influence that maximizes value in any single negotiation through the astute linking and sequencing of other negotiations and decisions related to one's operating activities.

This approach in complex settings is best executed by mapping out all potentially relevant negotiations, conflicts and operating decisions in order to integrate helpful connections among them, while minimizing any potentially harmful connections (see examples below).

Integrated negotiation is not to be confused with integrative negotiation, a different concept (as outlined above) related to a non-zero-sum approach to creating value in negotiations.

Integrated negotiation was first identified and labeled by international negotiator and author Peter Johnston in his book Negotiating with Giants.[17]

One of the examples cited in Johnston's book is that of J. D. Rockefeller deciding where to build his first major oil refinery. Instead of taking the easier, cheaper route from the oil fields to refine his petroleum in Pittsburgh, Rockefeller chose to build his refinery in Cleveland. Why? Because rail companies would be transporting his refined oil to market. Pittsburgh had just one major railroad, meaning it could dictate prices in negotiations, while Cleveland had three railroads that Rockefeller knew would compete for his business, potentially reducing his costs significantly. The leverage gained in these rail negotiations more than offset the additional operating costs of sending his oil to Cleveland for refining, helping establish Rockefeller's empire, while undermining his competitors who failed to integrate their core operating decisions with their negotiation strategies.[18]

Other examples of integrated negotiation include the following:

    In sports, athletes in the final year of their contracts will ideally hit peak performance so they can negotiate robust, long-term contracts in their favor.[19]
    A union needs to negotiate and resolve any significant internal conflicts to maximize its collective clout before going to the table to negotiate a new contract with management.
    If purchases for similar goods or services are occurring independent of one another across different government departments, recognizing this and consolidating orders into one large volume purchase can help create buying leverage and cost-savings in negotiations with suppliers.
    A tech start-up looking to negotiate being bought out by a larger industry player in the future can improve its odds of that happening by ensuring, wherever possible, that its systems, technology, competencies and culture are as compatible as possible with those of its most likely buyer.[20]
    A politician negotiating support for a presidential run may want to avoid bringing onboard any high-profile supporters who risk alienating other important potential supporters, while avoiding any unexpected new policies that could also limit the size of their growing coalition.[21]

Bad faith

When a party pretends to negotiate, but secretly has no intention of compromising, the party is considered negotiating in bad faith. Bad faith is a concept in negotiation theory whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.[22][23]

Bad faith negotiations are often used in political science and political psychology to refer to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of information processing.[24] The "inherent bad faith model" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by Ole Holsti to explain the relationship between John Foster Dulles' beliefs and his model of information processing.[25] It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.[26] A state is presumed implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Hamas's position on the state of Israel.[26][neutrality is disputed]
Negotiation Pie

The total of advantages and disadvantages to be distributed in a negotiation is illustrated with the term negotiation pie.[27] The course of the negotiation can either lead to an increase, shrinking, or stagnation of these values. If the negotiation parties are able to expand the total pie a win-win situation is possible assuming that both parties profit from the expansion of the pie. In practice, however, this maximisation approach is oftentimes impeded by the so-called small pie bias, i.e. the psychological underestimation of the negotiation pie's size. Likewise, the possibility to increase the pie may be underestimated due to the so-called incompatibility bias.[28] Contrary to enlarging the pie, the pie may also shrink during negotiations e.g. due to (excessive) negotiation costs.[28]
Strategies

There are many different ways to categorize the essential elements of negotiation.

One view of negotiation involves three basic elements: process, behavior and substance. The process refers to how the parties negotiate: the context of the negotiations, the parties to the negotiations, the tactics used by the parties, and the sequence and stages in which all of these play out. Behavior refers to the relationships among these parties, the communication between them and the styles they adopt. The substance refers to what the parties negotiate over: the agenda, the issues (positions and – more helpfully – interests), the options, and the agreement(s) reached at the end.[citation needed]

Another view of negotiation comprises four elements: strategy, process, tools, and tactics. Strategy comprises the top level goals – typically including relationship and the final outcome. Processes and tools include the steps to follow and roles to take in preparing for and negotiating with the other parties. Tactics include more detailed statements and actions and responses to others' statements and actions. Some add to this persuasion and influence, asserting that these have become integral to modern day negotiation success, and so should not be omitted.[citation needed]
Employing an advocate

A skilled negotiator may serve as an advocate for one party to the negotiation. The advocate attempts to obtain the most favorable outcomes possible for that party. In this process the negotiator attempts to determine the minimum outcome(s) the other party is (or parties are) willing to accept, then adjusts their demands accordingly. A "successful" negotiation in the advocacy approach is when the negotiator is able to obtain all or most of the outcomes their party desires, but without driving the other party to permanently break off negotiations.

Skilled negotiators may use a variety of tactics ranging from negotiation hypnosis,[citation needed] to a straightforward presentation of demands or setting of preconditions, to more deceptive approaches such as cherry picking. Intimidation and salami tactics may also play a part in swaying the outcome of negotiations.[citation needed]

Another negotiation tactic is bad guy/good guy. Bad guy/good guy is when one negotiator acts as a bad guy by using anger and threats. The other negotiator acts as a good guy by being considerate and understanding. The good guy blames the bad guy for all the difficulties while trying to get concessions and agreement from the opponent.[29]
BATNA

The best alternative to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA, is the most advantageous alternative course of action a negotiator can take should the current negotiation end without reaching agreement. The quality of a BATNA has the potential to improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward.[30] Alternatives need to be actual and actionable to be of value.[31] Negotiators may also consider the other party's BATNA and how it compares to what they are offering during the negotiation.[32][page needed]
Conflict styles

Kenneth W. Thomas identified five styles or responses to negotiation.[33][34] These five strategies have been frequently described in the literature and are based on the dual-concern model.[35] The dual concern model of conflict resolution is a perspective that assumes individuals' preferred method of dealing with conflict is based on two themes or dimensions:[36]

    A concern for self (i.e., assertiveness), and
    A concern for others (i.e., empathy).

Based on this model, individuals balance the concern for personal needs and interests with the needs and interests of others. The following five styles can be used based on individuals' preferences depending on their pro-self or pro-social goals. These styles can change over time, and individuals can have strong dispositions towards numerous styles.

Accommodating
    Individuals who enjoy solving the other party's problems and preserving personal relationships. Accommodators are sensitive to the emotional states, body language, and verbal signals of the other parties. They can, however, feel taken advantage of in situations when the other party places little emphasis on the relationship. Accommodation is a passive but prosocial approach to conflict. People solve both large and small conflicts by giving in to the demands of others. Sometimes, they yield because they realize that their position is in error, so they agree with the viewpoint adopted by others. In other cases, however, they may withdraw their demands without really being convinced that the other side is correct, but for the sake of group unity or in the interest of time--they withdraw all complaints. Thus, yielding can reflect either genuine conversion or superficial compliance.
Avoiding
    Individuals who do not like to negotiate and don't do it unless warranted. When negotiating, avoiders tend to defer and dodge the confrontational aspects of negotiating; however, they may be perceived as tactful and diplomatic. Inaction is a passive means of dealing with disputes. Those who avoid conflicts adopt a "wait and see" attitude, hoping that problems will solve themselves. Avoiders often tolerate conflicts, allowing them to simmer without doing anything to minimize them. Rather than openly discussing disagreements, people who rely on avoidance change the subject, skip meetings, or even leave the group altogether (Bayazit & Mannix, 2003). Sometimes they simply agree to disagree (a modus vivendi).
Collaborating
    Individuals who enjoy negotiations that involve solving tough problems in creative ways. Collaborators are good at using negotiations to understand the concerns and interests of the other parties. Collaborating is an active, pro-social, and pro-self approach to conflict resolution. Collaborating people identify the issues underlying the dispute and then work together to identify a solution that is satisfying to both sides. This orientation, which is also described as collaboration, problem solving, or a win-win orientation, entreats both sides in the dispute to consider their opponent's outcomes as well as their own[37]
Competing
    Individuals who enjoy negotiations because they present an opportunity to win something. Competitive negotiators have strong instincts for all aspects of negotiating and are often strategic. Because their style can dominate the bargaining process, competitive negotiators often neglect the importance of relationships. Competing is an active, pro-self means of dealing with conflict that involves forcing others to accept one's view. Those who use this strategy tend to see conflict as a win-lose situation and so use competitive, powerful tactics to intimidate others. Fighting (forcing, dominating, or contending) can take many forms, including authoritative mandate, challenges, arguing, insults, accusations, complaining, vengeance, and even physical violence (Morrill, 1995). These conflict resolution methods are all contentious ones because they involve imposing one's solution on the other party.
Compromising
    Individuals who are eager to close the deal by doing what is fair and equal for all parties involved in the negotiation. Compromisers can be useful when there is limited time to complete the deal; however, compromisers often unnecessarily rush the negotiation process and make concessions too quickly.

Types of negotiators

Three basic kinds of negotiators have been identified by researchers involved in The Harvard Negotiation Project. These types of negotiators are: soft bargainers, hard bargainers, and principled bargainers.

Soft
    These people see negotiation as too close to competition, so they choose a gentle style of bargaining. The offers they make are not in their best interests, they yield to others' demands, avoid confrontation, and they maintain good relations with fellow negotiators. Their perception of others is one of friendship, and their goal is agreement. They do not separate the people from the problem, but are soft on both. They avoid contests of wills and insist on agreement, offering solutions and easily trusting others and changing their opinions.
Hard
    These people use contentious strategies to influence, utilizing phrases such as "this is my final offer" and "take it or leave it." They make threats, are distrustful of others, insist on their position, and apply pressure to negotiate. They see others as adversaries and their ultimate goal is victory. Additionally, they search for one single answer, and insist you agree on it. They do not separate the people from the problem (as with soft bargainers), but they are hard on both the people involved and the problem.
Principled
    Individuals who bargain this way seek integrative solutions, and do so by sidestepping commitment to specific positions. They focus on the problem rather than the intentions, motives, and needs of the people involved. They separate the people from the problem, explore interests, avoid bottom lines, and reach results based on standards independent of personal will. They base their choices on objective criteria rather than power, pressure, self-interest, or an arbitrary decisional procedure. These criteria may be drawn from moral standards, principles of fairness, professional standards, and tradition.

Researchers from The Harvard Negotiation Project recommend that negotiators explore a number of alternatives to the problems they face in order to reach the best solution, but this is often not the case (as when you may be dealing with an individual using soft or hard bargaining tactics) (Forsyth, 2010).
Tactics

Tactics are always an important part of the negotiating process. More often than not they are subtle, difficult to identify and used for multiple purposes. Tactics are more frequently used in distributive negotiations and when the focus in on taking as much value off the table as possible.[38] Many negotiation tactics exist. Below are a few commonly used tactics.

Auction: The bidding process is designed to create competition.[39] When multiple parties want the same thing, pit them against one another. When people know that they may lose out on something, they want it even more. Not only do they want the thing that is being bid on, they also want to win, just to win. Taking advantage of someone's competitive nature can drive up the price.

Brinksmanship: One party aggressively pursues a set of terms to the point where the other negotiating party must either agree or walk away. Brinkmanship is a type of "hard nut" approach to bargaining in which one party pushes the other party to the "brink" or edge of what that party is willing to accommodate. Successful brinksmanship convinces the other party they have no choice but to accept the offer and there is no acceptable alternative to the proposed agreement.[40]

Bogey: Negotiators use the bogey tactic to pretend that an issue of little or no importance is very important.[41] Then, later in the negotiation, the issue can be traded for a major concession of actual importance.

Calling a higher authority: To mitigate too far reaching concessions, deescalate, or overcome a deadlock situation, one party makes the further negotiation process dependent on the decision of a decision maker, not present at the negotiation table.[42]

Chicken: Negotiators propose extreme measures, often bluffs, to force the other party to chicken out and give them what they want. This tactic can be dangerous when parties are unwilling to back down and go through with the extreme measure.

Defence in Depth: Several layers of decision-making authority is used to allow further concessions each time the agreement goes through a different level of authority.[43] In other words, each time the offer goes to a decision maker, that decision maker asks to add another concession to close the deal.

Deadlines: Give the other party a deadline forcing them to make a decision. This method uses time to apply pressure to the other party. Deadlines given can be actual or artificial.

Flinch: Flinching is showing a strong negative physical reaction to a proposal. Common examples of flinching are gasping for air, or a visible expression of surprise or shock. The flinch can be done consciously or unconsciously.[44] The flinch signals to the opposite party that you think the offer or proposal is absurd in hopes the other party will lower their aspirations.[45] Seeing a physical reaction is more believable than hearing someone saying, "I'm shocked."

Good Guy/Bad Guy: Within the tactic of good guy/bad guy (synonyms are good cop/bad cop or black hat/white hat) oftentimes positive and unpleasant tasks are divided between two negotiators on the same negotiation side or unpleasant tasks or decisions are allocated to an (real or fictitious) outsider. The good guy supports the conclusion of the contract and emphasises positive aspects of the negotiation (mutual interests). The bad guy criticises negative aspects (opposing interests). The division of the two roles allows more consistent behaviour and credibility of the individual negotiators. As the good guy promotes the contract, he/she can build trust with the other side.[46]

Highball/Lowball or Ambit claim: Depending on whether selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer that is not achievable. The theory is that the extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the resistance point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement).[47] Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.

The Nibble: Also known under salami tactic or quivering quill, nibbling is the demand of proportionally small concessions that haven't been discussed previously just before closing the deal.[41] This method takes advantage of the other party's desire to close by adding "just one more thing."

Snow Job: Negotiators overwhelm the other party with so much information that they have difficulty determining what information is important, and what is a diversion.[48] Negotiators may also use technical language or jargon to mask a simple answer to a question asked by a non-expert.

Mirroring: When people get on well, the outcome of a negotiation is likely to be more positive. To create trust and a rapport, a negotiator may mimic or mirror the opponent's behavior and repeat what they say. Mirroring refers to a person repeating the core content of what another person just said, or repeating a certain expression. It indicates attention to the subject of negotiation and acknowledges the other party's point or statement.[49] Mirroring can help create trust and establish a relationship.
Nonverbal communication
Main article: Nonverbal communication

Communication is a key element of negotiation. Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret those things that would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.[50]
Examples

Non-verbal "anchoring" In a negotiation, a person can gain the advantage by verbally expressing a position first. By anchoring one's position, one establishes the position from which the negotiation proceeds. In a like manner, one can "anchor" and gain advantage with nonverbal (body language) cues.

    Personal space: The person at the head of the table is the apparent symbol of power. Negotiators can negate this strategic advantage by positioning allies in the room to surround that individual.
    First impression: Begin the negotiation with positive gestures and enthusiasm. Look the person in the eye with sincerity. If you cannot maintain eye contact, the other person might think you are hiding something or that you are insincere. Give a solid handshake.[51][full citation needed][page needed]

Reading non-verbal communication Being able to read the non-verbal communication of another person can significantly aid in the communication process. By being aware of inconsistencies between a person's verbal and non-verbal communication and reconciling them, negotiators can to come to better resolutions. Examples of incongruity in body language include:

    Nervous Laugh: A laugh not matching the situation. This could be a sign of nervousness or discomfort. When this happens, it may be good to probe with questions to discover the person's true feelings.
    Positive words but negative body language: If someone asks their negotiation partner if they are annoyed and the person pounds their fist and responds sharply, "what makes you think anything is bothering me?"[52][page needed]
    Hands raised in a clenched position: The person raising his/her hands in this position reveals frustration even when he/she is smiling. This is a signal that the person doing it may be holding back a negative attitude.[53][page needed]
    If possible, it may be helpful for negotiation partners to spend time together in a comfortable setting outside of the negotiation room. Knowing how each partner non-verbally communicates outside of the negotiation setting helps negotiation partners sense incongruity between verbal and non-verbal communication.

Conveying receptivity The way negotiation partners position their bodies relative to each other may influence how receptive each is to the other person's message and ideas.

    Face and eyes: Receptive negotiators smile, make plenty of eye contact. This conveys the idea that there is more interest in the person than in what is being said. On the other hand, non-receptive negotiators make little to no eye contact. Their eyes may be squinted, jaw muscles clenched and head turned slightly away from the speaker
    Arms and hands: To show receptivity, negotiators should spread arms and open hands on table or relaxed on their lap. Negotiators show poor receptivity when their hands are clenched, crossed, positioned in front of their mouth, or rubbing the back of their neck.
    Legs and Feet: Receptive negotiators sit with legs together or one leg slightly in front of the other. When standing, they distribute weight evenly and place hands on their hips with their body tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators stand with legs crossed, pointing away from the speaker.
    Torso: Receptive negotiators sit on the edge of their chair, unbutton their suit coat with their body tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators may lean back in their chair and keep their suit coat buttoned.

Receptive negotiators tend to appear relaxed with their hands open and palms visibly displayed.[54][page needed]

Emotion

Emotions play an important part in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their effect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation. During negotiations, the decision as to whether or not to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative emotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior, and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations to break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often facilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining concessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task and relational outcomes[56] and may play out differently across cultural boundaries.[57]
Affect effect

Dispositions for affects affect various stages of negotiation: which strategies to use, which strategies are actually chosen,[58] the way the other party and their intentions are perceived,[59] their willingness to reach an agreement and the final negotiated outcomes.[60] Positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA) of one or more of the negotiating sides can lead to very different outcomes.
Positive affect

Even before the negotiation process starts, people in a positive mood have more confidence,[61] and higher tendencies to plan to use a cooperative strategy.[58] During the negotiation, negotiators who are in a positive mood tend to enjoy the interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics[62] and more cooperative strategies.[58] This in turn increases the likelihood that parties will reach their instrumental goals, and enhance the ability to find integrative gains.[63] Indeed, compared with negotiators with negative or natural affectivity, negotiators with positive affectivity reached more agreements and tended to honor those agreements more.[58] Those favorable outcomes are due to better decision making processes, such as flexible thinking, creative problem solving, respect for others' perspectives, willingness to take risks and higher confidence.[64] Post-negotiation positive affect has beneficial consequences as well. It increases satisfaction with achieved outcome and influences one's desire for future interactions.[64] The PA aroused by reaching an agreement facilitates the dyadic relationship, which brings commitment that sets the stage for subsequent interactions.[64]
PA also has its drawbacks: it distorts perception of self performance, such that performance is judged to be relatively better than it actually is.[61] Thus, studies involving self reports on achieved outcomes might be biased.
Negative affect

Negative affect has detrimental effects on various stages in the negotiation process. Although various negative emotions affect negotiation outcomes, by far the most researched is anger. Angry negotiators plan to use more competitive strategies and to cooperate less, even before the negotiation starts.[58] These competitive strategies are related to reduced joint outcomes. During negotiations, anger disrupts the process by reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side.[62] Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains.[65] Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it increases the likelihood that they will reject profitable offers.[62] Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor.[29] Anger does not help achieve negotiation goals either: it reduces joint gains[58] and does not boost personal gains, as angry negotiators do not succeed.[65] Moreover, negative emotions lead to acceptance of settlements that are not in the positive utility function but rather have a negative utility.[66] However, expression of negative emotions during negotiation can sometimes be beneficial: legitimately expressed anger can be an effective way to show one's commitment, sincerity, and needs.[62] Moreover, although NA reduces gains in integrative tasks, it is a better strategy than PA in distributive tasks (such as zero-sum).[64] In his work on negative affect arousal and white noise, Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins. Negotiation may be negatively affected, in turn, by submerged hostility toward an ethnic or gender group.[67]
Conditions for emotion affect

Research indicates that negotiator's emotions do not necessarily affect the negotiation process. Albarracın et al. (2003) suggested that there are two conditions for emotional affect, both related to the ability (presence of environmental or cognitive disturbances) and the motivation:

    Identification of the affect: requires high motivation, high ability or both.
    Determination that the affect is relevant and important for the judgment: requires that either the motivation, the ability or both are low.

According to this model, emotions affect negotiations only when one is high and the other is low. When both ability and motivation are low, the affect is identified, and when both are high the affect is identified but discounted as irrelevant to judgment.[68] A possible implication of this model is, for example, that the positive effects PA has on negotiations (as described above) is seen only when either motivation or ability are low.
Effect of partner's emotions

Most studies on emotion in negotiations focus on the effect of the negotiator's own emotions on the process. However, what the other party feels might be just as important, as group emotions are known to affect processes both at the group and the personal levels. When it comes to negotiations, trust in the other party is a necessary condition for its emotion to affect,[59] and visibility enhances the effect.[63] Emotions contribute to negotiation processes by signaling what one feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from engaging in destructive behaviors and to indicate what steps should be taken next: PA signals to keep in the same way, while NA points that mental or behavioral adjustments are needed.[64]
Partner's emotions can have two basic effects on negotiator's emotions and behavior: mimetic/ reciprocal or complementary.[60] For example, disappointment or sadness might lead to compassion and more cooperation.[64] In a study by Butt et al. (2005) that simulated real multi-phase negotiation, most people reacted to the partner's emotions in reciprocal, rather than complementary, manner. Specific emotions were found to have different effects on the opponent's feelings and strategies chosen:

    Anger caused the opponents to place lower demands and to concede more in a zero-sum negotiation, but also to evaluate the negotiation less favorably.[69] It provoked both dominating and yielding behaviors of the opponent.[60]
    Pride led to more integrative and compromise strategies by the partner.[60]
    Guilt or regret expressed by the negotiator led to better impression of him by the opponent, however it also led the opponent to place higher demands.[59] On the other hand, personal guilt was related to more satisfaction with what one achieved.[64]
    Worry or disappointment left bad impression on the opponent, but led to relatively lower demands by the opponent.[59]

Dealing with emotions

    Make emotions explicit and validate - Taking a more proactive approach in discussing one's emotions can allow for a negotiation to focus on the problem itself, rather than any unexpressed feelings. It is important to allow both parties to share any emotions he or she may have.
    Allow time to let off steam - It is possible that one party may feel angry or frustrated at some point during the negotiation. Rather than try to avoid discussing those feelings, allow the individual to talk it out. Sitting and listening, without providing too much feedback to the substance itself, can offer enough support for the person to feel better. Once the grievances are released, it may become easier to negotiate.
    Symbolic gestures - Consider that an apology, or any other simple act, may be one of the most effective and low cost means to reduce any negative emotions between parties.[16]

Problems with laboratory studies

Negotiation is a rather complex interaction. Capturing all its complexity is a very difficult task, let alone isolating and controlling only certain aspects of it. For this reason most negotiation studies are done under laboratory conditions, and focus only on some aspects. Although lab studies have their advantages, they do have major drawbacks when studying emotions:

    Emotions in lab studies are usually manipulated and are therefore relatively 'cold' (not intense). Although those 'cold' emotions might be enough to show effects, they are qualitatively different from the 'hot' emotions often experienced during negotiations.[70]
    In real life, people select which negotiations to enter, which affects emotional commitment, motivation and interests —but this is not the case in lab studies.[64]
    Lab studies tend to focus on relatively few well-defined emotions. Real-life scenarios provoke a much wider scale of emotions.[64]
    Coding the emotions has a double catch: if done by a third side, some emotions might not be detected as the negotiator sublimates them for strategic reasons. Self-report measures might overcome this, but they are usually filled only before or after the process, and if filled during the process might interfere with it.[64]

Group composition
Multi-party

While negotiations involving more than two parties is less often researched, some results from two-party negotiations still apply with more than two parties. One such result is that in negotiations it is common to see language similarity arise between the two negotiating parties. In three-party negotiations, language similarity still arose, and results were particularly efficient when the party with the most to gain from the negotiation adopted language similarities from the other parties.[71]
Team
Students from University of Tromsø and University of Toronto during 5th International Negotiation Tournament – Warsaw Negotiation Round in the Polish Senate (2014).

Due to globalization and growing business trends, negotiation in the form of teams is becoming widely adopted. Teams can effectively collaborate to break down a complex negotiation. There is more knowledge and wisdom dispersed in a team than in a single mind. Writing, listening, and talking, are specific roles team members must satisfy. The capacity base of a team reduces the amount of blunder, and increases familiarity in a negotiation.[72]

However, unless a team can appropriately utilize the full capacity of its potential, effectiveness can suffer. One factor in the effectiveness of team negotiation is a problem that occurs through solidarity behavior. Solidarity behavior occurs when one team member reduces his or her own utility (benefit) in order to increase the benefits of other team members. This behavior is likely to occur when interest conflicts rise. When the utility/needs of the negotiation opponent does not align with every team member's interests, team members begin to make concessions and balance the benefits gained among the team.[73]

Intuitively, this may feel like a cooperative approach. However, though a team may aim to negotiate in a cooperative or collaborative nature, the outcome may be less successful than is possible, especially when integration is possible. Integrative potential is possible when different negotiation issues are of different importance to each team member. Integrative potential is often missed due to the lack of awareness of each member's interests and preferences. Ultimately, this leads to a poorer negotiation result.

Thus, a team can perform more effectively if each member discloses his or her preferences prior to the negotiation. This step will allow the team to recognize and organize the team's joint priorities, which they can take into consideration when engaging with the opposing negotiation party. Because a team is more likely to discuss shared information and common interests, teams must make an active effort to foster and incorporate unique viewpoints from experts from different fields. Research by Daniel Thiemann, which largely focused on computer-supported collaborative tasks, found that the Preference Awareness method is an effective tool for fostering the knowledge about joint priorities and further helps the team judge which negotiation issues were of highest importance.[74]
Women

Many of the strategies in negotiation vary across genders, and this leads to variations in outcomes for different genders, often with women experiencing less success in negotiations as a consequence. This is due to a number of factors, including that it has been shown that it is more difficult for women to be self-advocating when they are negotiating. Many of the implications of these findings have strong financial impacts in addition to the social backlash faced by self-advocating women in negotiations, as compared to other advocating women, self-advocating men, and other advocating men. Research in this area has been studied across platforms, in addition to more specific areas like women as physician assistants.[75] The backlash associated with this type of behavior is attributed to the fact that to be self-advocated is considered masculine, whereas the alternative, being accommodating, is considered more feminine.[76] Males, however, do not appear to face any type of backlash for not being self-advocating.[77]

This research has been supported by multiple studies, including one which evaluated candidates participating in a negotiation regarding compensation. This study showed that women who initiated negotiations were evaluated more poorly than men who initiated negotiations. In another variation of this particular setup, men and women evaluated videos of men and women either accepting a compensation package or initiating negotiations. Men evaluated women more poorly for initiating negotiations, while women evaluated both men and women more poorly for initiating negotiations. In this particular experiment, women were less likely to initiate a negotiation with a male, citing nervousness, but there was no variation with the negotiation was initiated with another female.[78]

Research also supports the notion that the way individuals respond in a negotiation varies depending on the gender of the opposite party. In all-male groups, the use of deception showed no variation upon the level of trust between negotiating parties, however in mixed-sex groups there was an increase in deceptive tactics when it was perceived that the opposite party was using an accommodating strategy. In all-female groups, there were many shifts in when individuals did and did not employ deception in their negotiation tactics.[76]
Academic negotiation

The academic world contains a unique management system, wherein faculty members, some of which have tenure, reside in academic units (e.g. departments) and are overseen by chairs, or heads. These chairs/heads are in turn supervised by deans of the college where their academic unit resides. Negotiation is an area where faculty, chairs/heads and their deans have little preparation; their doctoral degrees are typically in a highly specialized area according to their academic expertise. However, the academic environment frequently presents with situations where negotiation takes place. For example, many faculty are hired with an expectation that they will conduct research and publish scholarly works. For these faculty, where their research requires equipment, space, and/or funding, negotiation of a "start-up" package is critical for their success and future promotion.[79][80] Also, department chairs often find themselves in situations, typically involving resource redistribution where they must negotiate with their dean, on behalf of their unit. And deans oversee colleges where they must optimize limited resources, such as research space or operating funds while at the same time creating an environment that fosters student success, research accomplishments and more.[79][80][81]

Integrative negotiation is the type predominately found in academic negotiation – where trust and long-term relationships between personnel are valued. Techniques found to be particularly useful in academic settings include:[79][80] (1) doing your homework – grounding your request in facts; (2) knowing your value; (3) listening actively and acknowledging what is being said,[82] (4) putting yourself in their shoes, (5) asking – negotiation begins with an ask, (6) not committing immediately, (7) managing emotion and (8) keeping in mind the principle of a "wise agreement",[82] with its associated emphasis on meeting the interests of both parties to the extent possible as a key working point. The articles by Callahan, et al.[79] and Amekudzi-Kennedy, et al.[80] contain several case studies of academic negotiations.
Etymology

The word "negotiation" originated in the early 15th century from the Old French negociacion from Latin negotiatio from neg- "no" and otium "leisure".[83] These terms mean "business, trade, traffic". By the late 1570s negotiation had the definition, "to communicate in search of mutual agreement." With this new introduction and this meaning, it showed a shift in "doing business" to "bargaining about" business.[83]

The reason past and future tense is used more commonly than present tense when speaking is because usually you are telling someone what you have done or what you plan on doing. Speaking in the present tense is used primarily to tell someone what you are currently doing.

As in previous lessons in 'Bored and Greeting' it is very common to have a conversation using the present tense when you run into somebody or when you make or receive a phone call.

Let's use this time now to incorporate what we have learned so far.

Person A: "Hi Jack. What are you doing?"
Person B: "Hi Mary. I'm filling out a job application."
Person A: "Are you finished with school already?"
Person B: "No. I have one more semester, but it would be great to have a job lined up."

Person A: "How is your day going?"
Person B: "Quite busy. I'm preparing for my presentation tomorrow on our marketing strategy. I'm not even half done yet."
Person A: "You must feel stressed out now."
Person B: "That's an understatement."

Person A: "What are you doing now?"
Person B: "I'm playing pool with my friends at a pool hall."
Person A: "I didn't know you play pool. Are you having fun?"
Person B: "I'm having a great time. How about you? What are you doing?"
Person A: "I'm taking a break from my homework. There seems to be no end to the amount of work I have to do."
Person B: "I'm glad I'm not in your shoes."

Marketing is the study and management of exchange relationships.[1][2] It is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers' needs and wants. Because marketing is used to attract customers, it is one of the primary components of business management and commerce.[3] Marketers can direct product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing).[4]

Regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors, including the perspective the marketers will use. These market orientations determine how marketers will approach the planning stage of marketing.[5] This leads into the marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold.[6][7] This can in turn be affected by the environment surrounding the product [8], the results of marketing research and market research[9], and the characteristics of the product's target market.[10]

Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods will be used to market the product.[4] This decision is based on the factors analyzed in the planning stage as well as where the product is in the product life cycle.[4]

Definition

Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as "the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large".[11] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to market with goods for sale. From a sales process engineering perspective, marketing is "a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction".[12]

Philip Kotler defined marketing as "Satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process".[13] and a decade later defines it as “a social and managerial process by which individuals and groups obtain what they want and need through creating, offering and exchanging products of value with others.”[13]

The Chartered Institute of Marketing defines marketing as "the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably".[14] A similar concept is the value-based marketing which states the role of marketing to contribute to increasing shareholder value.[15] In this context, marketing can be defined as "the management process that seeks to maximise returns to shareholders by developing relationships with valued customers and creating a competitive advantage".[15]

In the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included advertising, distribution and selling. However, because the academic study of marketing makes extensive use of social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology and neuroscience, the profession is now widely recognized as a science,[16] allowing numerous universities to offer Master-of-Science (MSc) programs.[17]

The process of marketing is that of bringing a product to market, which includes these steps: broad market research; market targeting and market segmentation; determining distribution, pricing and promotion strategies; developing a communications strategy; budgeting; and visioning long-term market development goals.[18] Many parts of the marketing process (e.g. product design, art director, brand management, advertising, inbound marketing, copywriting etc.) involve use of the creative arts.[citation needed][19]
Concept

The 'marketing concept' proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. This concept originated from Adam Smith's book The Wealth of Nations but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later.[20] Marketing and Marketing Concepts are directly related.

Given the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential:[21]

    Needs: Something necessary for people to live a healthy, stable and safe life. When needs remain unfulfilled, there is a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, water, and shelter; or subjective and psychological, such as the need to belong to a family or social group and the need for self-esteem.
    Wants: Something that is desired, wished for or aspired to. Wants are not essential for basic survival and are often shaped by culture or peer-groups.
    Demands: When needs and wants are backed by the ability to pay, they have the potential to become economic demands.

Marketing research, conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer's unmet needs.[22] Customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of "distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes."[23] Needs-based segmentation (also known as benefit segmentation) "places the customers' desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services."[24] Although needs-based segmentation is difficult to do in practice, it has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to segment a market.[25][22] In addition, a great deal of advertising and promotion is designed to show how a given product's benefits meet the customer's needs, wants or expectations in a unique way.[26]
B2B and B2C Marketing

The two major segments of marketing are business-to-business (B2B) marketing and business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing. [4]
B2B marketing

B2B (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.

Examples of products sold through B2B marketing include:

    Major equipment
    Accessory equipment
    Raw materials
    Component parts
    Processed materials
    Supplies
    Business services[4]

The four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:

    Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)
    Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)
    Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)
    Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) [4]

B2C marketing

Business-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.

Traditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.[27]
C2B marketing

Consumer-to-business marketing or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.
C2C marketing

Customer to customer marketing or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.[28]
Differences in B2B and B2C marketing

The different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.[4]

    Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customer's wants and needs. B2C demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.[4]
    Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.[4]
    Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.[4]
    Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.[4]
    Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.[4]
    Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.[4]
    Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.[4]
    Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.[4]
    Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.[4]
    Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.[4]
    Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.[4]

Orientations
Main article: History of marketing § Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice

A marketing orientation has been defined as a "philosophy of business management."[5] or "a corporate state of mind"[29] or as an "organisation[al] culture"[30] Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:[31]
Product

A firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.[32][33]
Sales
Further information: History of marketing § Selling orientation

A sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants. This orientation seeks to attain the highest possible sales through promotion and direct sales techniques.[34] The sales orientation "is typically practiced with unsought goods."[35] One study found that industrial companies are more likely to hold a sales orientation than consumer goods companies.[36] The approach may also suit scenarios in which a firm holds dead stock, or otherwise sells a product that is in high demand, with little likelihood of changes in consumer tastes diminishing demand.

A 2011 meta analyses[37] found that the factors with the greatest impact on sales performance are a salesperson's sales related knowledge (knowledge of market segments, sales presentation skills, conflict resolution, and products), degree of adaptiveness (changing behavior based on the aforementioned knowledge), role clarity (salesperson's role is expressly to sell), cognitive aptitude (intelligence) and work engagement (motivation and interest in a sales role).
Production
Further information: History of marketing § Production orientation

A firm focusing on a production orientation specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve economies of scale or economies of scope. A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically, Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is "one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations."[38]
Marketing
Further information: Market orientation

The marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.[39] Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.[40]

The marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:

    Customer orientation: A firm in the market economy can survive by producing goods that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining consumer demand is vital for a firm's future viability and even existence as a going concern.
    Organizational orientation: The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments.
    As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.
    The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.
    Mutually beneficial exchange: In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer, on the other hand, gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability, and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.

Societal marketing
Main article: Societal marketing

A number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior value. Marketing organizations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities. Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice triple bottom line reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or green marketing is an extension of societal marketing.[41]
The Marketing Mix
Main article: Marketing mix

A marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the marketing plan typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.
The 4Ps

The traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: product, price, promotion, and place.[6][42]
The 4Ps of the marketing mix stand for product, price, place and promotion
One version of the marketing mix is the 4Ps method.
Outline

Product
    The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the end-user's needs and wants. The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. Branding, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, brand, or company. [43]
Pricing
    This refers to the process of setting a price for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product—monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of pricing science. [44]
Place (or distribution)
    This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and retailers who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called Place or Placement, referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. [44]
Promotion
    This includes all aspects of marketing communications; advertising, sales promotion, including promotional education, public relations, personal selling, product placement, branded entertainment, event marketing, trade shows and exhibitions. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers. The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.[44]

Criticisms

One of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. [45] An inside-out approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of "selling" the organization's products and messages to the "outside" or external stakeholders.[43] In contrast, an outside-in approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.[46]

From a model-building perspective, the 4 Ps has attracted a number of criticisms. Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, "communication" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and "promotion" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either promotion or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.[47] Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.

Other important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.[48]
Modifications and extensions

To overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing

include "people", "process", and "physical evidence" and are often applied in the case of services marketing[49] Other extensions have been found necessary in retail marketing, industrial marketing and internet marketing.

    Physical- the environment customers are in when they are marketed to
    People- service personnel and other customers with whom customers interact with. These people form part of the overall service experience.
    Process- the way in which orders are handled, customers are satisfied and the service is delivered[50]
    Physical Evidence- the tangible examples of marketing that the customer has encountered before buying the advertised product
    Productivity- the ability to provide consumers with quality product using as few resources as possible[51]

The 4Cs

In response to environmental and technological changes in marketing, as well as criticisms towards the 4Ps approach, the 4Cs has emerged as a modern marketing mix model.
Outline

Consumer (or Client)

The consumer refers to the person or group that will acquire the product. This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. [7]

Cost

Cost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. [7]

Convenience

Like "Place" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. [7]

Communication

Like "Promotion" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. [7]
Environment
Main article: Market environment

The term "marketing environment" relates to all of the factors (whether internal, external, direct or indirect) that affect a firm's marketing decision-making/planning. A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:

    The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control
    The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control
    The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself[8]

Macro
Main article: Macromarketing

A firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:

    economic
    social
    political
    technological

A common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a PESTLE analysis, a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key macroeconomic conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, inflation, unemployment, etc.), social trends/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. [8]
Micro

A firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.

A firm's micro-environment typically spans:

    Customers/consumers
    Employees
    Suppliers
    The Media

In contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.[8]
Internal

A firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:

    Labor
    Inventory
    Company Policy
    Logistics
    Budget
    Capital Assets [8]

Research
Main article: Marketing research

Marketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between marketing research and market research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.

Marketing researchers use statistical methods (such as quantitative research, qualitative research, hypothesis tests, Chi-square tests, linear regression, correlation coefficients, frequency distributions, Poisson and binomial distributions, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.[52]

The stages of research include:

    Define the problem
    Plan research
    Research
    Interpret data
    Implement findings [9]

Segmentation
Main article: Market segmentation

Market segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.[10] The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.

Market segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.

Segmentation involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:

    Geographic (such as a country, region, city, town)
    Psychographic (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)
    Demographic (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)
    Gender
    Income
    Life-Cycle (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)
    Lifestyle (e.g. tech savvy, active)
    Behavioural (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) [53]

Once a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The DAMP acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:

    Discernable – how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.
    Accessible – how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm
    Measurable – can the segment be quantified and its size determined?
    Profitable – can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?

The next step in the targeting process is the level of differentiation involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:

    Undifferentiated – where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment
    Differentiated – in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment
    Niche – in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market

Positioning concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. [54]
Promotional Mix
See also: Integrated marketing communications and Promotional mix

The promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media
Personal selling
Main article: Personal selling

Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). [4]

Sales promotion
Main article: Sales promotion

Sales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:

    free samples
    contests
    premiums
    trade shows
    giveaways
    coupons
    sweepstakes
    games

Depending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. [4]
Public relations
Main article: Public relations

Public relations is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.

Public relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. [4]
Advertising
Main article: advertising

Advertising occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:

    TV commercials
    Radio commercials
    Radio ads
    Magazine ads
    Online ads
    Billboards
    Event sponsorship
    Direct mail ads
    Transit ads [4]

Social Media
Main article: Social media marketing

Social media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Snapchat and YouTube allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content..[4]
The Marketing Plan
Main article: Marketing plan

The area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.
Process

Within the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:

    Mission Statement
    SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis
    Marketing Objectives
    Targeted Marketing Strategy
    Marketing Mix
    Implementation [4]

Levels of marketing objectives within an organization

As stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.

At the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a conglomerate), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.

A strategic business unit (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.

The functional level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.
Product life cycle
Further information: Product life-cycle management (marketing)
Product lifecycle

The product life cycle (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:

    A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage
    No product lasts perpetually on the market
    A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC

In the introduction stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.

During the growth stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.

When the product hits maturity, its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.

During decline, demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. [4]

Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services).[1][2][need quotation to verify][3][4] Simply put, it is "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit. It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors."[5]

Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.

The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company. A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.

Forms
Main article: List of business entities

Forms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:

    Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgments against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, a computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.
    Partnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[6]
    Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned, and they can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.
    Cooperative: Often referred to as a "co-op", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.
    Limited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[7][8]
    Franchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[9] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[10]
    A company limited by guarantee: Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in England. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having share capital.
    A company limited by shares: The most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a "company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested" with corporations being "the most common example of a limited company."[11] This type of company is common in England and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a
        publicly traded company or a
        privately held company
    A company limited by guarantee with a share capital: A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return. This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.[12]
    A limited liability company: "A company—statutorily authorized in certain states—that is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer", i.e., L.L.C.[11] LLC structure has been called "hybrid" in that it "combines the characteristics of a corporation and of a partnership or sole proprietorship". Like a corporation, it has limited liability for members of the company, and like a partnership, it has "flow-through taxation to the members" and must be "dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member".[13]
    An unlimited company with or without a share capital: A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case, the doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.

Less common types of companies are:

    Companies formed by letters patent: Most corporations by letters patent are corporations sole and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.
    Charter corporations: Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies. Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the Bank of England is a corporation formed by a modern charter).
    Statutory companies: Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.

Note that "Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held."[14]

In legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the "members". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include "segregated portfolio companies" and restricted purpose companies.

There are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.

Companies are also sometimes distinguished into public companies and private companies for legal and regulatory purposes. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and a future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.

A parent company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.

Interior decorators, beauticians, hair stylists, make-up artists, tanning salons, laundromats, dry cleaners, and pest controllers are service businesses.

Activities
Accounting
Main article: Accounting

Accounting is the measurement, processing, and communication of financial information about economic entities[15][16] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[17] Accounting, which has been called the "language of business",[18] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[19] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms.
Finance
Main article: Finance

Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub categories: public finance, corporate finance, and personal finance.Activities also include budgeting, forecasting and lending money, and is defined as the management of money.[20]
Manufacturing
Main article: Manufacturing

Manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.
Marketing
Main article: Marketing

Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as "the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."[21] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.

With the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called digital marketing. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.
Research and development
Main article: Research and development

Research and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]
Safety
Main article: Safety

Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually.[22] Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduce incidents, insurance costs, and workers' compensation claims.[23] New technologies, like wearable safety devices[24] and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the "canary in the coal mine" and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees.
Sales
Main article: Sales

Sales are activity related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies' success.[25]
Management
Main article: Management
See also: Outline of business management

The efficient and effective operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called management. The major branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, operations management, service management, and information technology management.[citation needed]

Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business' value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources. These resources are administered in at least six functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.[citation needed]
Restructuring state enterprises

In recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the People's Republic of China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system.[26] Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.

Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can, therefore, be described as a "process optimization process". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.[who?]
Organization and regulation
See also: Theory of the firm
Time required to start a business in 2017[27]

Most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.

The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:

    The size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
    The sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.
    Tax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason.
    Disclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate "person". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.

Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.

A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:

    General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.
    Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like "real" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.
    In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.
    "Going public" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the US, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot "go public".

Commercial law
Main article: Corporate law
Offices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District

A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[28] The word "corporation" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[29]

In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern the treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.

Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.

Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.
Capital
Mexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City

When businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.

Capital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.

Major stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (the USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.

Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).

The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.

Other types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.
Intellectual property
Main article: Intellectual property

Businesses often have important "intellectual property" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.
Trade union
Main article: Trade union

A trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labor contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment".[30] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.

kangaroo


A kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning 'large foot'). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the Red Kangaroo, the Antilopine Kangaroo, and the Eastern and Western Grey Kangaroo of the Macropus genus. The family also includes many smaller species which include the wallabies, tree-kangaroos, wallaroos, pademelons and the Quokka, some 63 living species in all.  Kangaroos are endemic to the continent of Australia, while the smaller macropods are found in Australia and New Guinea.

In general, larger kangaroos have adapted much better to changes wrought to the Australian landscape by humans and though many of their smaller cousins are endangered, they are plentiful. They are not farmed to any extent, but wild kangaroos are shot for meat, over which there is controversy.  Steve Dow: "An industry that's under the gun". Sydney Morning Herald online, September 26, 2007.

The kangaroo is an Australian icon: it is featured on the Australian coat of arms,  Australia's coat of arms URL accessed January 6, 2007.  on some of its currency,  The Australian currency URL accessed January 6, 2007.  and is used by many Australian organisations, including Qantas.  The Kangaroo symbol URL accessed January 6, 2007.



The word kangaroo derives from the Guugu Yimidhirr word gangurru, referring to a grey kangaroo.  Etymology of mammal names URL accessed January 7, 2007.  The name was first recorded as "Kangooroo or Kanguru" on 4 August,1770, by Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook on the banks of the Endeavour River at the site of modern Cooktown, when HM Bark Endeavour was beached for almost seven weeks to repair damage sustained on the Great Barrier Reef.

A common myth about the kangaroo's English name is that it came from the Aboriginal words for "I don't understand you." According to this legend, Captain James Cook and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks were exploring Australia when they happened upon the animal. They asked a nearby local what the creatures were called. The local responded "Kangaroo", meaning "I don't understand you", which Cook took to be the name of the creature.  Tour lecture,  , Dawsonville, GA. 
Kangaroo soon became adopted into standard English where it has come to mean any member of the family of kangaroos and wallabies.  Male kangaroos are called bucks, boomers, jacks, or old men; females are does, flyers, or jills, and the young ones are joeys.  Animal Bytes: Kangaroo and Wallaby URL accessed January 7, 2007.  The collective noun for kangaroos is a mob, troop, or court. Kangaroos are sometimes colloquially referred to as roos.



A Tasmanian Forester (Eastern Grey) Kangaroo in motion.
There are four species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos:
* The Red Kangaroo (Macropus rufus) is the largest surviving marsupial anywhere in the world. Fewer in numbers, the Red Kangaroo occupies the arid and semi-arid centre of the continent. A large male can be 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).   
* The Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) is less well-known than the red (outside of Australia), but the most often seen, as its range covers the fertile eastern part of the continent. 
* The Western Grey Kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus) is slightly smaller again at about 54 kg (119 lb) for a large male. It is found in the southern part of Western Australia, South Australia near the coast, and the Darling River basin.
* The Antilopine Kangaroo (Macropus antilopinus) is, essentially, the far-northern equivalent of the Eastern and Western Grey Kangaroos. Like them, it is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious.

In addition, there are about 50 smaller macropods closely related to the kangaroo in the family Macropodidae.



Red Kangaroo (Macropus rufus)
Europeans have long regarded Kangaroos as strange animals. Early explorers described them as creatures that had heads like deer (without antlers), stood upright like men, and hopped like frogs.  Combined with the two-headed appearance of a mother kangaroo, this led many back home to dismiss them as travellers' tales for quite some time.

Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like all marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.




Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The comfortable hopping speed for Red Kangaroo is about 20 25 km/h (13 16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained, over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for  nearly two kilometres.    This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators.

Because of its long feet, it cannot walk correctly. To move at slow speeds, it uses its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs. It then raises its hind feet forward, in a form of locomotion called "crawl-walking."

The average life expectancy of a kangaroo is about 4 6 years.



Different species of kangaroos eat different diets.  Eastern grey kangaroos are predominantly grazers eating a wide variety of grasses whereas some other species (e.g. red kangaroos and swamp wallabies) include significant amounts of shrubs in the diet. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi.  Many species are nocturnal  Archives URL accessed January 7, 2007.  and crepuscular,  Columbus Zoo article URL accessed January 7, 2007.  usually spending the days resting in shade and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.

Because of its grazing, kangaroos have developed specialized teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by new teeth that grow in the back.



Despite having a herbivorous diet similar to ruminants such as cattle which release large quantities of methane through exhaling and eructation, kangaroos release virtually none. The hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate, which is then used to provide further energy. Scientists are interested in the possibility of transferring the bacteria responsible from kangaroos to cattle, since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times greater than that of carbon dioxide.  Radio Australia - Innovations: 
"Methane In Agriculture." 15 August  2004. Retrieved 28 August 2007.



Kangaroos have few natural predators. The Thylacine, considered by palaeontologists to have once been a major natural predator of the kangaroo, is now extinct. Other extinct predators included the Marsupial Lion, Megalania and the Wonambi. However, with the arrival of humans in Australia at least 50,000 years ago and the introduction of the dingo about 5,000 years ago, kangaroos have had to adapt.   The mere barking of a dog can set a full-grown male boomer into a wild frenzy.   Wedge-tailed Eagles and other raptors usually eat kangaroo carrion. Goannas and other carnivorous reptiles also pose a danger to smaller kangaroo species when other food sources are lacking.

Along with dingos and other canids, introduced species like foxes and feral cats also pose a threat to kangaroo populations. Kangaroos and wallabies are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if presented with the option. If pursued into the water, a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.  Canadian Museum of Nature - Kangaroo URL accessed January 6, 2007.  Another defensive tactic described by witnesses is catching the attacking dog  with the forepaws and disembowelling it with the hind legs.



Newborn joey sucking on a teat in the pouch
Kangaroos have developed a number of adaptations to a dry, infertile continent and highly variable climate. As with all marsupials, the young are born at a very early stage of development   after a gestation of 31 36 days. At this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat. In comparison, a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old, and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive. The joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months (180 320 days for the Western Grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time. It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months.

The female kangaroo is usually pregnant in permanence, except on the day she gives birth; however, she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch. This is known as diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources.  The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. In addition, the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in the pouch.

Unusually, during a dry period, males will not produce sperm, and females will only conceive if there has been enough rain to produce a large quantity of green vegetation.

Hindleg of a kangaroo Kangaroos and wallabies have large, stretchy  tendons in their hind legs. They store elastic strain energy in the tendons of their large hind legs, providing most of the energy required for each hop by the spring action of the tendons rather than by any muscular effort. This is true in all animal species which have muscles connected to their skeleton through elastic elements such as tendons, but the effect is more pronounced in kangaroos.

There is also a link between the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is expelled from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated that, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and that the extra energy is required to carry extra weight. For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly-sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other continents but economy: in an infertile continent with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival.

A sequencing project of the Kangaroo genome was started in 2004 as a collaboration between Australia (mainly funded by the state of Victoria) and the National Institutes of Health in the US.  Kangaroo hops in line for genome sequencing URL accessed January 6, 2007.  The genome of a marsupial such as the kangaroo is of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans: mice are too close and haven't developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote. The dairy industry has also expressed some interest in this project.



Eye disease  is rare but not new among kangaroos.  The first official report of kangaroo blindness took place in 1994, in central New South Wales.  The following year, reports of blind kangaroos appeared in Victoria and South Australia.  By 1996, the disease had spread "across the desert to Western Australia".  Australian authorities were concerned that the disease could spread to other livestock and possibly humans.  Researchers at the Australian Animal Health Laboratories in Geelong detected a virus called the Wallal virus in two species of midge, believed to have been the carriers.       Veterinarians also discovered that less than three percent of kangaroos exposed to the virus developed blindness.



Before European settlement, the kangaroo was a very important animal for Australian Aborigines, for its meat, hide, bones and sinews. In addition, there were important Dreaming stories and ceremonies involving the kangaroo.  Aherrenge is a current kangaroo dreaming site in the Northern Territory. The game of Marn grook was played using a ball made from kangaroo  by the Kurnai people.

Unlike many of the smaller macropods, kangaroos have fared well since European settlement. European settlers cut down forests to create vast grasslands for sheep and cattle grazing, added stock watering points in arid areas, and have substantially reduced the number of dingoes.

Kangaroos are shy and retiring by nature, and in normal circumstances present no threat to humans. Male kangaroos often "box" amongst each other, playfully, for dominance, or in competition for mates. The dexterity of their forepaws is utilised in both punching and grappling with the foe, but the real danger lies in a serious kick with the hindleg. The sharpened toenails can disembowel an opponent.

There are very few records of kangaroos attacking humans without provocation, however several such unprovoked attacks in 2004 spurred fears of a rabies-like disease possibly affecting the marsupials. The only reliably documented case of a fatality from a kangaroo attack occurred in New South Wales, in 1936. A hunter was killed when he tried to rescue his two dogs from a heated fray. Other suggested causes for erratic and dangerous kangaroo behaviour include extreme thirst and hunger.

In 2003, Lulu, an Eastern Grey, saved a farmer's life.  She received the RSPCA National Animal Valor Award on May 19 of the next year.



A "kangaroo crossing" sign on an Australian highway.
A kangaroo crossing a highway.
A collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo. Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise have been known to leap in front of cars.  Since kangaroos in mid-bound can reach speeds of around 50 km/h (31 mph) and are relatively heavy, the force of impact can be severe.  Small vehicles may be destroyed, while larger vehicles may suffer engine damage. The risk of harm to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact.  As a result, "kangaroo crossing" signs are commonplace in Australia.

Vehicles that frequent isolated roads, where roadside assistance may be scarce, are often fitted with "roo bars" to minimise damage caused by collision. Bonnet-mounted devices, designed to scare wildlife off the road with ultrasound and other methods, have been devised and marketed.

If a female is the victim of a collision, animal welfare groups ask that her pouch be checked for any surviving joey, in which case it may be removed to a wildlife sanctuary or veterinary surgeon for rehabilitation.  Likewise, when an adult kangaroo is injured in a collision, a vet, the RSPCA or the National Parks and Wildlife Service can be consulted for instructions on proper care. In New South Wales, rehabilitation of kangaroos is carried out by volunteers from WIRES.



Occasionally, individuals take on the task of rearing a recovered joey themselves. The rule-of-thumb says that if the joey is already covered with fur at the time of the accident (as opposed to still being in its embryonic stage), it stands a good chance of growing up properly. Lactose-free milk is required, otherwise the animal may develop blindness. They hop readily into a cloth bag when it is lowered in front of them approximately to the height where the mother's pouch would be. The joey's instinct is to "cuddle up", thereby endearing themselves to their keepers, but after hand-rearing a joey, it cannot usually be released into the wild and be expected to provide for itself immediately. Usually wildlife sanctuaries are willing to adopt kangaroos which are no longer practical, or have grown too large to contain, needing at least 1 acre and 7ft boundary fences for a fully grown kangaroo.




Kangaroos have been featured on coins, as well as being used as emblems and logos. They have also been used as mascots and in the naming of sports teams and are extremely well-represented in films, television, toys and souvenirs around the world.

leopard



The leopard (Panthera pardus) is an Old World mammal of the Felidae family and the smallest of the four 'big cats' of the genus Panthera, along with the tiger, lion, and jaguar. Leopards that are melanistic, either all-black or very dark in coloration, are known colloquially as Black Panthers.

Once distributed across southern Eurasia and Africa, from Korea to South Africa and Spain, it has disappeared from much of its former range and now chiefly occurs in subsaharan Africa. There are fragmented populations in Israel, the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, Malaysia, and western China. Despite the loss of range and continued population declines, the cat remains a least concern species;  its numbers are greater than that of the other Panthera species, all of which face more acute conservation concerns.

The species' success owes in part to its opportunistic hunting behaviour and its adaptability to a variety of habitats. The leopard consumes virtually any animal it can catch and ranges from rainforest to desert. Its ecological role resembles that of the similarly-sized cougar in the Americas. Physically, the spotted cat most closely resembles the jaguar, although it is of lighter build.



In Antiquity, it was believed that a leopard was a hybrid between a lion and a panther, as is reflected in its name, a Greek compound word derived from λέων léon ("lion") and πάρδος párdos ("male panther"), the latter related to Sanskrit पृदाकु pṝdāku ("snake, tiger, panther").

A panther can be any of several species of large felid; in North America, the term refers to cougars, in South America, jaguars, and elsewhere, leopards. Early naturalists distinguished between leopards and panthers not by colour (a common misconception), but by the length of the tail panthers having longer tails than leopards.

Felis pardus was one of the many species described in Linnaeus's 18th-century work, Systema Naturae.

The generic component of its modern scientific designation, Panthera pardus, is derived from Latin via Greek πάνθηρ pánthēr. A folk etymology held that it was a compound of παν pan ("all") and θηρ ("beast"). However, it is believed instead to derive from an Indo-Iranian word meaning "whitish-yellow, pale"; in Sanskrit, this word's reflex was पाण्डर pāṇḍara, from which was derived पुण्डरीक puṇḍárīka ("tiger", among other things), then borrowed into Greek.




The leopard is an agile and graceful predator. Although smaller than the other members of Panthera, the leopard is still able to take large prey given a massive skull that well utilizes powerful jaw muscles.  Its body is comparatively long for a cat and its legs are short.  Head and body length is between 90 and 190 cm, the tail reaches 60 to 110cm. Shoulder height is 45 to 80 cm. Males are considerably larger than females and weigh 37 to 90 kg compared to 28 to 60 kg for females. Ronald M. Nowak: Walker's Mammals of the World. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999 ISBN 0-8018-5789-9

One of many spotted cats, a leopard may be mistaken for a cheetah or a jaguar. The leopard has rosettes rather than cheetah's simple spots, but they lack internal spots, unlike the jaguar. The leopard is larger and less lanky than the cheetah but smaller than the jaguar. The leopard's black, irregular rosettes serve as camouflage. They are circular in East Africa but tend to be square in southern Africa.  .

Leopards have been reported to reach 21 years of age in captivity.




A melanistic leopard, or "black panther"
A melanistic morph of the leopard occurs particularly in mountainous areas and rain forests. The black color is heritable and caused by only one recessive gene locus. In some regions, for example on the Malayan Peninsula, up to half of all leopards are black. In Africa black leopards seem to be most common in the Ethiopian Highlands. While they are commonly called black panthers, the term is not applied exclusively to leopards. Black leopards are less successful on the African plains because their colouration makes them stand out.




As of 1996, the leopard had the largest distribution of any wild cat,  although populations before and since have shown a declining trend and are fragmented outside of subsaharan Africa. The IUCN notes that within subsaharan Africa the species is "still numerous and even thriving in marginal habitats" where other large cats have disappeared, but that populations in North Africa may be extinct. In Asia, data on distribution are mixed: populations in Southwest and Central Asia are small and fragmented; in the northeast portion of the range, they are critically endangered; and in Indian, Southeast Asia, and China, the cat is still relatively abundant.  Leopards also like to live in grasslands, woodlands and riverside forests.



Graceful and stealthy, leopards are famous for their ability to go undetected. They are good, agile climbers, but cannot get down from a tree headfirst, because they do not have the ankle flexibility—the only two cats that do are the Margay and the Clouded Leopard. Female leopard. Note the white spots on the back of the ears used for communication with cubs when hunting in long grassAlong with climbing, they are strong swimmers but not as fond of water as tigers; for example, leopards will not normally lie in water. They are mainly nocturnal but can be seen at any time of day and will even hunt during daytime on overcast days. In regions where they are hunted, nocturnal behaviour is more common. These cats are solitary, avoiding one another. However, three or four are sometimes seen together. Hearing and eyesight are the strongest of these cats' senses and are extremely acute. Olfaction is relied upon as well, but not for hunting. When making a threat, leopards stretch their backs, depress their ribcages between their shoulder blades so they stick out, and lower their heads (similar to domestic cats). During the day they may lie in bush, on rocks, or in a tree with their tails hanging below the treetops and giving them away.



Leopards are opportunistic hunters. Although mid-sized animals are preferred, the leopard will eat anything from dung beetles to 900 kg male giant elands.  Nowell, K.; Jackson, P. eds. (1996).  Wild Cats. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan. IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. (see Panthera Pardus, pp. 24 – 29.)  Their diet consists mostly of ungulates and monkeys, but rodents, reptiles, amphibians, birds and fish are also eaten. Schaller, p. 290  In fact, they hunt about 90 different species of animals. A solitary dog is a potential prey for leopards, although a pack of dogs can kill or drive off a leopard. Even large pythons are potential prey for leopards. In Africa, mid-sized antelopes provide a majority of the leopard's prey, especially impala and Thomson's gazelles. Schaller, p. 291  In Asia the leopard preys on deer such as chitals and muntjacs as well as various Asian antelopes and Ibex. Leopards have even been spotted killing and eating crocodiles.

The leopard stalks its prey silently and at the last minute pounces on its prey and strangles its throat with a quick bite. Leopards often hide their kills in dense vegetation or take them up trees,  and are capable of carrying animals up to three times their own weight this way. Storing carcasses up trees keeps them away from other predators such as spotted hyenas, jackals, tigers and lions, though the latter will occasionally be successful in climbing and fetching the leopard kills. Schaller, p. 293

One survey of nearly 30 research papers found preferred prey weights of 10 to 40 kg, with 25 kg most preferred. Along with impala and chital, a preference for bushbuck and common duiker was found. Other prey selection factors include a preference for prey in small herds, in dense habitat, and those that afford the predator a low risk of injury.

A male may follow a female who catches his attention. Eventually fighting for reproductive rights can take place. Depending on the region, leopards may mate all year round (Asia and Africa) or seasonally during January to February (Manchuria and Siberia). The estrous cycle lasts about 46 days and the female usually is in heat for 6–7 days. 
   Cubs are usually born in a litter of 2–3, but infant mortality is high and mothers are not commonly seen with more than 1–2 cubs. The pregnant females find a cave, crevice among boulders, hollow tree, or thicket to give birth and make a den. Cubs open their eyes after a period of 10 days. The fur of the young tends to be longer and thicker than that of adults. Their pelage is also more gray in color with less defined spots. Around three months the infants begin to follow the mother out on hunts. At one year of age leopard young can probably fend for themselves but they remain with the mother for 18–24 months.




Studies of leopard home range size have tended to focus on protected areas, which may have led to skewed data; as of the mid-1980s, only 13% of the leopard range actually fell within a protected area.    In their IUCN survey of the literature, Nowell and Jackson suggest male home territories vary between 30-78 square kilometers, but just 15-16 km² for females.  Research in a conservation area in Kenya shows similar territory sizes and sex differential: 32.8 km² ranges for males, on average, and 14 km² for females.    In Nepal, somewhat larger male ranges have been found at about 48 km², while female ranges are in-keeping with other research, at 17 km²; female home territories were seen to decrease to just five to seven km² when young cubs were present, while the sexual difference in range size seemed to be in positive proportion to overall increase.     However, significant variations in size of home territories have been suggested across the leopard's range. In Namibia, for instance, research that focussed on spatial ecology in farmlands outside of protected areas found ranges that were consistently above 100 km², with some more than 300 km²; admitting that their data were at odds with others', the researchers also suggested little or no sexual variation in the size of territories.  Virtually all sources suggest that males do have larger ranges. There seems to be little or no overlap in territory amongst males, although overlap exists between the sexes; one radio-collar analysis in the Ivory Coast found a female home range completely enclosed within a male's.

The leopard is solitary and, aside from mating, interactions between individuals appear to be infrequent.  Aggressive enounters have been observed, however. Two of five males studied over a period of a year at a game reserve in South Africa died, both violently. One was initially wounded in a male-male territorial battle over a carcass; taken in by researchers, it was released after a successful convalescence only to be killed by a different male a few months later. A second was killed by another predator, possibly a spotted hyena. A third of the five was badly wounded in intraspecific fighting, but recovered.



Indian Leopard
It has been suggested that there may be as many as 30 extant subspecies of the Leopard.
However, modern taxonomic analyses have demonstrated that only 8/9 subspecies are valid.  Olga Uphyrkina et al. (November 2001).

A pseudo-melanistic leopard has a normal background colour, but its excessive markings have coalesced so that its back seems to be an unbroken expanse of black. In some specimens, the area of solid black extends down the flanks and limbs; only a few lateral streaks of golden-brown indicate the presence of normal background colour. Any spots on the flanks and limbs that have not merged into the mass of swirls and stripes are unusually small and discrete, rather than forming rosettes. The face and underparts are paler and dappled like those of ordinary spotted leopards.

In a paper about panthers and ounces of Asia, Reginald Innes Pocock used a photo of a leopard skin from southern India; it had large black-rimmed blotches, each containing a number of dots and it resembled the pattern of a jaguar or clouded leopard. Another of Pocock's leopard skins from southern India had the normal rosettes broken up and fused and so much additional pigment that the animal looked like a black leopard streaked and speckled with yellow.

Most other colour morphs of leopards are known only from paintings or museum specimens. There have been very rare examples where the spots of a normal black leopard have coalesced to give a jet black leopard with no visible markings. Pseudo-melanism (abundism) occurs in leopards. The spots are more densely packed than normal and merge to largely obscure the background colour. They may form swirls and, in some places, solid black areas. Unlike a true black leopard the tawny background colour is visible in places. One pseudo-melanistic leopard had a tawny orange coat with coalescing rosettes and spots, but white belly with normal black spots (like a black-and-tan dog).

A 1910 description of a pseudo-melanistic leopard:

Another pseudo-melanistic leopard skin was described in 1915 by Holdridge Ozro Collins who had purchased it in 1912. It had been killed in Malabar, India that same year.

In May 1936, the British Natural History Museum exhibited the mounted skin of an unusual Somali leopard. The pelt was richly decorated with an intricate pattern of swirling stripes, blotches, curls and fine-line traceries. This is different from a spotted leopard, but similar to a King Cheetah hence the modern cryptozoology term King Leopard. Between 1885 and 1934, six pseudo-melanistic leopards were recorded in the Albany and Grahamstown districts of South Africa. This indicated a mutation in the local leopard population. Other King Leopards have been recorded from Malabar in southwestern India. Shooting for trophies may have wiped out these populations.

Pumapard, Rothschild Museum, Tring
A pumapard is a hybrid animal resulting from a union between a leopard and a puma. Three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late 1890s and early 1900s by Carl Hagenbeck at his animal park in Hamburg, Germany. Most did not reach adulthood. One of these was purchased in 1898 by Berlin Zoo.  A similar hybrid in Berlin Zoo purchased from Carl Hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma. Hamburg Zoo's specimen was the reverse pairing, the one in the black and white photo, fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess. 
Whether born to a female Puma mated to a male Leopard, or to a male Puma mated to a female Leopard, pumapards inherit a form of dwarfism. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a Puma-like long body (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent), but short legs. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny or greyish with brown, chestnut or "faded" rosettes.

Leopards have been known to humans since antiquity and have featured in the art, mythology and folklore of many countries where they have occurred historically, such as Ancient Greece, Persia and Rome, as well as some where they haven't such as England. The modern use of the leopard as an emblem for sport or coat of arms is much more restricted to Africa, though numerous products worldwide have used the name.


Leopards were kept in a menagerie established by King John at the Tower of London in the 13th century; around 1235 three animals were given to Henry III by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.



Despite its size, this largely nocturnal and arboreal predator is difficult to see in the wild. A female leopard in the Sabi Sands of South Africa illustrating just how close tourists can get to these wild cats.The best location to see leopards in Africa is in the Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve in South Africa, where leopards are habituated to safari vehicles and are seen on a daily basis at very close range. In Asia, one can see leopards Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, which has one of the world's highest density of wild leopards, but even here sightings are by no means guaranteed because more than half the park is closed off to the public, allowing the animals to thrive. Another good destination for leopard watching is the recently reopened Wilpattu National Park, also in Sri Lanka. In India the leopards are found all over the country and there is maximum man-animal conflict here only as they are spread everywhere.The best places in India can be national parks in Madhya Pradesh and in Uttarakhand.



Coat of arms of the German state of Baden-Württemberg

The lion passant guardant or "leopard" is a frequently used charge in heraldry, most commonly appearing in groups of three. The heraldric leopard lacks spots and sports a mane, making it visually almost identical to the heraldric lion, and the two are often used interchangeably. These traditional lion passant guardants appear in the coat of arms of England and many of its former colonies; more modern naturalistic (leopard-like) depictions appear on the coat of arms of several African nations including Benin, Malawi, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and  Gabon which uses a black panther. The Leopard is also the unofficial national animal of Germany, replacing the Tiger, which was, along with the eagle, the national animal of Nazi Germany. The leopard tank was a German designed tank which entered service in 1965.



The Leopard men were a West African secret society who practised cannibalism. They were centred in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire.

Members would dress in leopard skins, waylaying travellers with sharp claw-like weapons in the form of leopards' claws and teeth. The victims' flesh would be cut from their bodies and distributed to members of the society. There was a superstitious belief that this ritual cannibalism would strengthen both members of the society as well as their entire tribe.




Although most leopards will tend to avoid humans, people are occasionally targeted as prey. Most healthy leopards prefer wild prey to humans, but cats who are injured, sickly or struggling with a shortage of regular prey often turn to hunting people and may become habituated to it. In the most extreme cases, both in India, a leopard dubbed "the Leopard of Rudraprayag" is claimed to have killed over 125 people and the infamous leopardess called "Panar Leopard" killed over 400 after being injured by a poacher and thus being made unable to hunt normal prey. The "Leopard of Rudraprayag" and the "Panar Leopard" were both killed by the famed hunter Jim Corbett. Man-eating leopards are considered bold by feline standards and commonly enter human settlements for prey, more so than their lion and tiger counterparts. Kenneth Anderson, who had first hand experience with many man-eating leopards, described them as far more threatening than tigers;

However because they can subsist on small prey and are less dependent on large prey, leopards are less likely to turn to man-eating than either lions or tigers.



Possibly the most famous cinematic leopard is the pet in the film Bringing Up Baby (1938) where its misadventures create madcap comedy for stars Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn; the movie is one of the American Film Institute's "100 Greatest (American) Films".

* In the 1999 Tarzan movie by Disney, a vicious leopard, Sabor, was Tarzan's natural and mortal enemy, although the Mangani name for leopards established in the books is "Sheeta".

* In Passion in the Desert (1997), a French soldier (played by British actor Ben Daniels) while lost in Egypt during Napoleon's Egyptian campaign stumbles upon a leopard and develops a strange relationship with the animal.

Traditionally, the leopard is an uncommon name or mascot for sporting teams, though it has been used in several African soccer teams: the AFC Leopards, formed in 1964, are a soccer club based in Nairobi, Kenya, while the Black Leopards play in South Africa's Premier Soccer League, the Royal Leopards in Swaziland's Premier League, and the Golf Leopards in the Sierra Leone National Premier League. More recently, the leopard emblem has been a part of the English Basketball League since the 1990s with the Essex Leopards and later London Leopards. The New Zealand Rugby League has featured the Otahuhu Leopards and then the Tamaki Leopards.

The use of Leopards by companies is uncommon, though Nissan Leopard was a luxury sports car produced by Nissan in the 1980s and Apple Inc. released Mac OS X version 10.5, nicknamed "Leopard" on October 26th, 2007.

In The Chronicles of Narnia; The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, leopards are seen fighting alongside Peter Pevensie.

penguin



A penguin encounters a human during Antarctic summer.
Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere.

The number of penguin species is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin biodiversity varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the subfamily Spheniscinae. Some sources consider the White-flippered Penguin a separate Eudyptula species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the Little Penguin (e.g. Williams, 1995; Davis & Renner, 2003); the actual situation seems to be more complicated (Banks et al. 2002). Similarly,  it is still unclear whether the Royal Penguin is merely a color morph of the Macaroni penguin. Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of Rockhopper penguins (Davis & Renner, 2003). Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not, contrary to popular belief, found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least ten  species live in the temperate zone; one lives as far north as the Galápagos Islands: the Galápagos Penguin.

The largest living species is the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the Little Blue Penguin (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's Rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2000 km south of the Equator 35 mya , in a climate decidedy warmer than today.

Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid, and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend half of their life on land and half in the oceans.

Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably on account of there being no land predators in Antarctica or the nearby offshore islands that prey on or attack penguins. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the leopard seal. Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (9 ft); they become nervous at about that distance. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

Penguins are superbly adapted to an aquatic life. Their wings have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. 
On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.

All penguins are countershaded - that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. This is for camouflage. A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.

Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.

Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called "tobogganing", which conserves energy while moving quickly.  They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.

Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds (Wever et al 1969); this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies (Jouventin et al 1999). Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this hypothesis (Sivak et al 1987).

Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which are designed to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air).  The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing.  In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves.  They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.

They can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream.           The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.



Some penguins mate for life, others for just one season. They generally raise a small brood, and the parents cooperate in caring for the clutch and the young. During the cold season on the other hand the mates separate for several months to protect the egg. Usually, the male stays with the egg and keeps it warm while the female goes to sea to find food for the baby. When the female comes back, they switch roles.

When mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to "steal" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick.  In some species, such as Emperor Penguins, young penguins assemble in large groups called crèches .



Isabelline Adélie penguin on Gourdin Island, December 2002
Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage.  These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess Isabella of Austria vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of Ostend--which took three years to accomplish.   Isabellinism is different from albinism, though the faded color of the plumage calls albinism to mind.  Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

ORDER SPHENISCIFORMES 

Taxonomy: Clarke et al. (2003) and Ksepka et al. (2006) apply the phylogenetic taxon Spheniscidae what here is referred to as Spheniscinae. Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon Sphenisciformes to flightless taxa, and establish (Clarke et al. 2003) the phylogenetic taxon Pansphenisciformes as equivalent to the Linnean taxon Sphenisciformes, i.e., including any flying basal "proto-penguins" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian phylogeny is presently resolved, this seems spurious and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.



The evolutionary history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary biogeography; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the alpha taxonomy of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005 (Bertelli & Giannini 2005, Baker et al. 2006, Ksepka et al. 2006, Slack et al. 2006), the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.

According to the comprehensive review of the available evidence by Ksepka et al. (2006), the basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event somewhere in the general area of (southern) New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica. Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less than   apart rather than the   of today. The most recent common ancestor of penguins and their sister clade can be roughly dated to the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary, around 70-68 mya (Baker et al. 2006, Slack et al. 2006) The exact divergence dates according to Baker et al. (2006) mentioned in this section are not as precisely resolved as it appears to be due to uncertainties of the molecular clock used. 
What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the Cretaceous, the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities (see also Flightless Cormorant).



The oldest known fossil penguin species is Waimanu manneringi, which lived in the early Paleocene epoch of New Zealand, or about 62 mya (Slack et al. 2006). While they were not as well adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins, Waimanu were generally loon-like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were - as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct - already adapting to underwater locomotion.

Perudyptes from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from Argentina proves that by the Bartonian (Middle Eocene), some 39-38 mya 
Contra Baker et al. (2006). ,
primitive penguins had spread to South America and were in the process of expanding into Atlantic waters (Clarke et al. 2003).



During the Late Eocene and the Early Oligocene (40-30 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed. Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The New Zealand Giant Penguin was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on New Zealand, the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.

Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the paraphyletic subfamily called Palaeeudyptinae. More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the phylogeny if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least 2 major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in Patagonia, and at least one other - which is or includes the paleeeudyptines as recognized today - occurred on most Antarctic and subantarctic coasts.

But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin radiation: on Seymour Island, Antarctica, for example, around ten known species of penguins ranging from medium to huge size apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the Priabonian (Late Eocene) (Jadwiszczak 2006). It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae - were they considered valid -, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi) (Ksepka et al. 2006).  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall Icadyptes salasi, actually occurred as far north as northern Peru about 36 mya.

In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the Paleogene, around 25 mya. Interestingly, their decline and disappearance coincides with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful (Baker et al. 2006). A new lineage, the Paraptenodytes which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early Neogene saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile Palaeospheniscinae, as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin biodiversity of our time.



Modern penguins consititute two undisputed clades and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships (Bertelli & Giannini 2005). The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic (Baker et al. 2006). Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya (Baker et al. 2006), it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.

The genus Aptenodytes appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches, incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch, they are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered  on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.

Pygoscelis contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external morphology, these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as Aptenodytes' autapomorphies are in most cases fairly pronounced adaptations related to that genus' extreme habitat conditions. As the former genus, Pygoscelis seems to have diverged during the Bartonian 
In fact, it is fairly likely that during the Bartonian, there was a near-synchronous but allopatric split between the ancestors of Aptenodytes, Pygoscelis, and the common ancestor of all remaining genera (Baker et al. 2006). ,
but the range expansion and radiation which lead to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later, around the Burdigalian stage of the Early Miocene, roughly 20-15 mya (Baker et al. 2006).

The genera Spheniscus and Eudyptula contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on South America; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack carotenoid coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins in nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the Chattian (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya (Baker et al. 2006). While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a Pliocene radiation, taking place some 4-2 mya (Baker et al. 2006).

The Megadyptes - Eudyptes clade occurs at similar latitudes (though not as far north as the Galapagos Penguin), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene (Langhian, roughly 15-14 mya), but again, the living species of Eudyptes are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late Tortonian (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene (Baker et al. 2006).

It is most interesting to note that the geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global cooling documented in the paleoclimatic record (Baker et al. 2006). The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the ice ages some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of Spheniscus to South America and eventually beyond (Baker et al. 2006).

Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, a sharp drop in global average temperature from 14 to 12 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.



Penguin ancestry beyond Waimanu remains unknown and not well resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and grebes is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies. On the other hand, different DNA sequence datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.

What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except paleognaths and fowl) which comprises what is sometimes called "higher waterbirds" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl. This group contains such birds as storks, rails, and the seabirds, with the possible exception of the Charadriiformes (Fain & Houde 2004).

Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to Ciconiiformes (e.g. Slack et al. 2006) or to Procellariiformes (Baker et al. 2006) has been suggested. Some (e.g. Mayr 2005) think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of anhingas and cormorants) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three.

The Auk of the Northern Hemisphere is superficially similar to penguins, they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some to be a product of moderate convergent evolution   Convergence and divergence in the evolution of aquatic birds by Marcel Van Tuinen, Dave Brian Butvill, John A. W. Kirsch and S. Blair Hedges



The word Penguin is thought by some to derive from the Welsh words pen (head) and gwyn (white),  Oxford English Dictionary. Accessed March 21, 2007.  applied to the Great Auk, which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black), or from an island off Newfoundland known as Pengwyn, due to a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from Breton.) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.

It is also possible that penguin comes from the Latin pinguis, “fat”. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French pingouin, German Pinguin) have i instead of e as the first vowel.  However, a Welsh 'i' is often sound-shifted to an 'e' in the English language, .

Another theory states that the word is an alteration of “pen-wing”, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence for this.

Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling pace and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black and white plumage is often likened to a tuxedo suit. Perhaps in reaction to this cutesy stereotype, fictional penguins are occasionally presented as grouchy or even sinister. Penguins have also been the subject of many books and documentary films such as Happy Feet and Surf's Up, both CGI-Animated Animal Adventure Films, March of the Penguins, a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors, and a parody film entitled Farce of the Penguins. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based in the North Pole.  This is incorrect as there are almost no wild penguins in the northern hemisphere, and those only barely (northernmost of the Galápagos). Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas, perhaps the most notable of these is Pingu - created by Silvio Mazzola in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.

John_Adams



John Adams, Jr. (October 30,1735   July 4, 1826)  was the second President of the United States (1797 1801). He also served as America's first Vice President (1789 1797). He was defeated for re-election in the "Revolution of 1800" by Thomas Jefferson. Adams was also the first President to reside in the newly built White House in Washington, D.C., which was completed in 1800.

Adams, a sponsor of the American Revolution in Massachusetts, was a driving force for independence in 1776; Jefferson called him the "Colossus of Independence". He represented the Continental Congress in Europe. He was a major negotiator of the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain, and chiefly responsible for obtaining the loans from the Amsterdam money market necessary for the conduct of the Revolution. His prestige secured his two elections as Washington's Vice President and his election to succeed him.   As President, he was frustrated by battles inside his own Federalist party against a faction led by Alexander Hamilton, but he broke with them to avert a major conflict with France in 1798, during the Quasi-War crisis. He became the founder of an important family of politicians, diplomats and historians, and in recent years his reputation has improved.



Birthplace of John Adams, Quincy, Massachusetts.
John Adams was the oldest of three brothers, born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735 by the Old Style, Julian calendar), in Braintree, Massachusetts, though in an area which became part of Quincy, Massachusetts in 1792. His birthplace is now part of Adams National Historical Park. His father, a farmer and a Deacon, also named John (1690-1761), was a fourth-generation descendant of Henry Adams, who immigrated from Barton St David, Somerset, England, to Massachusetts Bay Colony in about 1636, from a Welsh male line called Ap Adam.  /ref> His mother was Susanna Boylston Adams. Ferling (1992) ch 1  Who is a descendant of the Boylstons of Brookline, one of the colony's most vigorous and successful families.

Young Adams went to Harvard College at age sixteen (in 1751). MSN Encarta, John Adams  His father expected him to become a minister, but Adams had doubts.  After graduating in 1755, he taught school for a few years in Worcester, allowing himself time to think about his career choice.  After much reflection, he decided to become a lawyer, and studied law in the office of James Putnam, a prominent lawyer in Worcester. In 1758, he was admitted to the bar. From an early age, he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men.  These litter his diary.  He put the skill to good use as a lawyer, often recording cases he observed so that he could study and reflect upon them.  His report of the 1761 argument of James Otis in the superior court of Massachusetts as to the legality of Writs of Assistance is a good example. Otis’s argument inspired Adams with zeal for the cause of the American colonies.  Ferling (1992) ch 2

In 1764, Adams married Abigail Smith (1744–1818), the daughter of a Congregational minister,Rev. William Smith, at Weymouth, Massachusetts. Their children were Abigail (1765-1813); future president John Quincy (1767-1848); Susanna (1768–1770); Charles (1770-1800); Thomas Boylston (1772-1832); and Elizabeth (1775) who was stillborn.

Adams was not a popular leader like his second cousin, Samuel Adams; instead, his influence emerged through his work as a constitutional lawyer and his intense analysis of historical examples, Ferling (1992) p 117  together with his thorough knowledge of the law and his dedication to the principles of republicanism. Adams often found his inborn contentiousness to be a restraint in his political career.

Adams wanted to secure approval from the people, and he saw his chance in the British/colonial conflict. He became well known for his essays and energetic resolutions against British taxation and regulation. In 1774 Massachusetts sent him to the Continental Congress. In 1775 war broke out between the colonies and Great Britain. Adams was one of the first few delegates to recognize that a compromise with the British was pointless. In 1776 he worked hard to break away from Britain by using a formal declaration of independence. On July 2, 1776 Congress voted for the resolution, "these colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states."  Two days later, they passed the Declaration of Independence.

Adams first rose to prominence as an opponent of the Stamp Act of 1765. In that year, he drafted the instructions which were sent by the inhabitants of Braintree to its representatives in the Massachusetts legislature, and which served as a model for other towns to draw up instructions to their representatives. In August 1765, he anonymously contributed four notable articles to the Boston Gazette (republished in The London Chronicle in 1768 as True Sentiments of America and also known as A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law).  In the letter he suggested that there was a connection between the Protestant ideas that Adams' Puritan ancestors brought to New England and the ideas that suggested they resist the Stamp Act.  In the former he explained that the opposition of the colonies to the Stamp Act was because the Stamp Act deprived the American colonists of two basic rights guaranteed to all Englishmen, and which all free men deserved: rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried only by a jury of one's peers.  The "Braintree Instructions" were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, while the Dissertation was an essay in political education.

In December 1765, he delivered a speech before the governor and council in which he pronounced the Stamp Act invalid on the ground that Massachusetts, being without representation in Parliament, had not assented to it.  Ferling (1992) pp 53-63



In 1770, a street confrontation resulted in British soldiers killing four civilians in what became known as the Boston Massacre. The soldiers involved, who were arrested on criminal charges, had trouble finding legal counsel.  Finally, they asked Adams to defend them.  Although he feared it would hurt his reputation, he agreed. One of the soldiers, Captain Thomas Preston gave Adams a symbolic "single guinea" as a retaining fee, Chinard, John Adams, 58-60  the only fee he received in the case. Or, as stated in the biography of John Adams by David McCullough, Adams received nothing more than a retainer of eighteen guineas. McCullough, John Adams, pg. 66

Six of the soldiers were acquitted.  Two who had fired directly into the crowd were charged with murder but were convicted only of manslaughter.

Despite his previous misgivings, Adams was elected to the Massachusetts General Court (the colonial legislature) in June of 1770, while still in preparation for the trial.




In 1772, Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson announced that he and his judges would no longer need their salaries paid by the Massachusetts legislature, because the Crown would henceforth assume payment drawn from customs revenues. Boston radicals protested and asked Adams to explain their objections.  In "Two Replies of the Massachusetts House of Representatives to Governor Hutchinson" Adams argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter was with the person of the king and their allegiance was only to him.  If a workable line could not be drawn between parliamentary sovereignty and the total independence of the colonies, he continued, the colonies would have no other choice but to choose independence.

In Novanglus; or, A History of the Dispute with America, From Its Origin, in 1754, to the Present Time Adams attacked some essays by Daniel Leonard that defended Hutchinson's arguments for the absolute authority of Parliament over the colonies. In Novanglus Adams gave a point-by-point refutation of Leonard's essays, and then provided one of the most extensive and learned arguments made by the colonists against British imperial policy. It was a systematic attempt by Adams to describe the origins, nature, and jurisdiction of the unwritten British constitution. Adams used his wide knowledge of English and colonial legal history to show the provincial legislatures were fully sovereign over their own internal affairs, and that the colonies were connected to Great Britain only through the King.



Massachusetts sent Adams to the first and second Continental Congresses in 1774 and from 1775 to 1778.  In 1775 he was also appointed the chief judge of the Massachusetts Superior Court.  In June 1775, with a view of promoting the union of the colonies, he nominated George Washington of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the army then assembled around Boston. His influence in Congress was great, and almost from the beginning, he sought permanent separation from Britain. On October 5, 1775, Congress created the first of a series of committees to study naval matters.

On May 15, 1776 the Continental Congress, in response to escalating hostilities which had climaxed a year prior at Lexington and Concord, urged that the states begin constructing their own constitutions.

John Trumbull's famous painting depicts the five-man drafting committee presenting their work to the Congress. John Adams is standing in the center of the painting.
Today, the Declaration of Independence is remembered as the great revolutionary act, but Adams and most of his contemporaries saw the Declaration as a mere formality. The resolution to draft independent constitutions was, as Adams put it, "independence itself."  Ferling (1992) ch 8 p 146

Over the next decade, Americans from every state gathered and deliberated on new governing documents. As radical as it was to actually write constitutions (prior convention suggested that a society's form of government needn't be codified, nor should its organic law be written down in a single document), what was equally radical was the nature of American political thought as the summer of 1776 dawned.  Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (1993)



At that time several Congressmen turned to Adams for advice about framing new governments.  Adams tired of repeating the same thing, and published the pamphlet Thoughts on Government (1776), which was subsequently influential in the writing of many state constitutions. Many historians argue that Thoughts on Government should be read as an articulation of the classical theory of mixed government.  Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries, dating back to Aristotle, a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, or the monarch, nobles, and people was required to preserve order and liberty.  Ferling (1992) pp 155-7, 213-5

Using the tools of Republicanism in the United States the patriots believed it was corrupt and nefarious aristocrats, in the English Parliament and stationed in America, who were guilty of the British assault on American liberty.  Unlike others, Adams thought that the definition of a republic had to do with its ends, rather than its means.  He wrote in Thoughts on Government, "there is no good government but what is republican. That the only valuable part of the British constitution is so; because the very definition of a republic is 'an empire of laws, and not of men.'"  Thoughts on Government defended bicameralism, for "a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies, and frailties of an individual." Thoughts on Government, Works of John Adams, IV:195  He also suggested that the executive should be independent, as should the judiciary.  Thoughts on Government' was enormously influential and was referenced as an authority in every state-constitution writing hall.



On June 7, 1776, Adams seconded the resolution introduced by Richard Henry Lee that "these colonies are, and of a right ought to be, free and independent states," acting as champion of these resolutions before the Congress until their adoption on July 2, 1776.  Ferling (1992) ch 8. An 1813 letter by Adams, in which he said that one-third of the people supported the revolution, refers to the French revolution in the 1790s.

He was appointed on a committee with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman, to draft a Declaration of Independence. Although that document was largely drafted by Jefferson, Adams occupied the foremost place in the debate on its adoption. He deferred the writing to Jefferson believing it would be better received having been written by him. Adams believed Jefferson wrote profoundly better than any man in Congress, and he himself was "obnoxious and disliked." Many years later, Jefferson hailed Adams as, "The Colossus of that Congress the great pillar of support to the Declaration of Independence, and its ablest advocate and champion on the floor of the House." Lipscomb & Bergh, eds. Writings of Thomas Jefferson (1903), vol 13, p xxiv  In 1777, Adams resigned his seat on the Massachusetts Superior Court to serve as the head of the Board of War and Ordinance, as well as many other important committees.  Marquis 1607-1896

Congress chose Adams to represent the fledgling union in Europe in 1777, and again in 1779. On the second trip, he was appointed as minister plenipotentiary charged with the mission of negotiating a treaty of peace and a treaty of commerce with Great Britain; he went to Europe in September 1779. The French government, however, did not approve of Adams’s appointment and subsequently, on the insistence of the French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay and Henry Laurens were appointed to cooperate with Adams. In the event Jay, Adams and Franklin played the major part in the negotiations. Overruling Franklin, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France; instead, they dealt directly with the British commissioners.  Ferling (1992) ch 11-12

Throughout the negotiations, Adams was especially determined that the right of the United States to the fisheries along the Atlantic coast should be recognized. The American negotiators were able to secure a favorable treaty, which gave Americans ownership of all lands east of the Mississippi, except Florida, which was transferred to Spain as its reward. The treaty was signed on November 30, 1782.

After these negotiations began, Adams had spent some time as the ambassador in the Netherlands, then the only other well-functioning Republic in the world.  In July 1780, he had been authorized to execute the duties previously assigned to Laurens. With the aid of the Dutch patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states had been the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition, in 1778).  During this visit, he also negotiated a loan of five million guilders. It was floated by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink. Up till 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders.   In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce, the second such treaty between the United States and a foreign power (after the 1778 treaty with France). The house that Adams purchased during this stay in The Netherlands became the first American embassy on foreign soil anywhere in the world.

In 1785, John Adams was appointed the first American minister to the Court of St. James's (that is, ambassador to Great Britain). When he was presented to his former sovereign, George III, the King intimated that he was aware of Adams's lack of confidence in the French government. Adams admitted this, stating: "I must avow to your Majesty that I have no attachment but to my own country.”

Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain referred to this episode in July 7, 1976 at the White House.  She said, "John Adams, America's first Ambassador, said to my ancestor, King George III, that it was his desire to help with the restoration of "the old good nature and the old good humor between our peoples." That restoration has long been made, and the links of language, tradition, and personal contact have maintained it."  See   /ref>



Massachusetts's new constitution, ratified in 1780 and written largely by Adams himself, structured its government most closely on his views of politics and society. Ronald M. Peters. The Massachusetts Constitution of 1780: A Social Compact (1978) p 13 says Adams was its "principal architect."  It was the first constitution written by a special committee and ratified by the people.  It was also the first to feature a bicameral legislature, a clear and distinct executive with a partial (2/3) veto (although he was restrained by an executive council), and a distinct judicial branch.

While in London, Adams published a work entitled A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States (1787). In it he repudiated the views of Turgot and other European writers as to the viciousness of the framework of state governments. Turgot argued that countries that lacked aristocracies needn't have bicameral legislatures.  He thought that  republican governments feature “all authorities into one center, that of the nation.” Turgot to Richard Price, March 22, 1778, in Works of John Adams, IV:279  In the book, Adams suggested that "the rich, the well-born and the able" should be set apart from other men in a senate--that would prevent them from dominating the lower house.  Wood (2006) has maintained that Adams had become intellectually irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous and searching debate as well as shaping experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical conception of politics which understood government as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new conception of popular sovereignty now saw the people-at-large as the sole possessors of power in the realm.  All agents of the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited period of time. Adams had completely missed this concept and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics. Wood, Revolutionary Characters: What Made the Founders Different (2006) pp 173-202; see also Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (1993).   Yet Wood overlooks Adams' peculiar definition of the term "republic," and his support for a constitution ratified by the people. Thompson,1999  He also underplays Adams' belief in checks and balances. "Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest,” Adams wrote.  Works of John Adams, IV:557  Adams did as much as anyone to put the idea of "checks and balances" on the intellectual map.

Adams never bought a slave and declined on principle to employ slave labor. Littlefield, Daniel C. "John Jay, the Revolutionary Generation, and Slavery." New York History 2000 81(1): p 91-132. ISSN 0146-437X  Abigail Adams opposed slavery and employed free blacks in preference to her father's two domestic slaves. He spoke out against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, opposed use of black soldiers in the Revolution, and tried to keep the issue out of national politics.  Ferling (1992) pp 172-3



John Adams, portrait by John Trumbull.
While Washington was the unanimous choice for president, Adams came in second in the electoral college and became Vice President in the presidential election of 1789. He played a minor role in the politics of the early 1790s and was reelected in 1792. Washington never asked Adams for input on policy and legal issues.  Ferling (1992) ch 15

One of the best known Adams quotes concluded of the institution of the Vice Presidency: This is the most unimportant position human ever made. "Wizje Stanów Zjednoczonych w Pismach Ojców Założycieli", Warsaw, 1976  His main task while in this office was presiding over Senate. Most Vice Presidents after him were not regarded as powerful or significant members of Presidential administrations, with some exceptions (such as Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, Walter Mondale, Al Gore or Dick Cheney, who were regarded as influential members of their President's teams).

In the first year of Washington's administration, Adams became deeply involved in a month-long Senate controversy over what the official title of the President would be, favoring grandiose titles such as "His Majesty the President" or "His High Mightiness" over the simple "President of the United States" that won the issue. The pomposity of Adams's stance, and his being overweight, led to the nickname "His Rotundity."

As president of the Senate, Adams cast 31 tie-breaking votes—a record that only John C. Calhoun came close to tying, with 28.  Ferling (1992) p 311  His votes protected the president's sole authority over the removal of appointees and influenced the location of the national capital. On at least one occasion, he persuaded senators to vote against legislation that he opposed, and he frequently lectured the Senate on procedural and policy matters. Adams's political views and his active role in the Senate made him a natural target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, as a result of a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters, he began to exercise more restraint.  When the two political parties formed, he joined the Federalist Party, but never got on well with its dominant leader Alexander Hamilton. Because of Adams's seniority and the need for a northern president, he was elected as the Federalist  nominee for president in 1796, over Thomas Jefferson, the leader of the opposition Democratic-Republican Party. His success was due to peace and prosperity; Washington and Hamilton had averted war with Britain by the Jay Treaty of 1795.  Ferling (1992) pp 316-32

Adams' two terms as Vice President were frustrating experiences for a man of his vigor, intellect, and vanity. He complained to his wife Abigail, "My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived."




During the presidential campaign of 1796 Adams was the presidential candidate of the Federalist Party and Thomas Pinckney, the Governor of South Carolina, his running mate. The federalists wanted Adams as their presidential candidate to crush Thomas Jefferson's bid. Most federalists would have preferred Hamilton to be a candidate.  Although Hamilton and his followers supported Adams, they also held a grudge against him.  They did consider him to be the lesser of the two evils. However, they thought Adams lacked the seriousness and popularity that had caused Washington to be successful, and also feared that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable, and stubborn to follow their directions.  Adams' opponents were former Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, who was joined by Senator Aaron Burr of New York on the Democratic-Republican ticket.

As was customary, Adams stayed in his home town of Quincy rather than actively campaign for the Presidency.  He wanted to stay out of what he called the silly and wicked game. His party, however, campaigned for him, while the Republicans campaigned for Jefferson.

It was expected that Adams would dominate the votes in New England, while Jefferson was expected to win in the Southern states. In the end, Adams won the election by a narrow margin of 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson (who became the vice president).



When Adams entered office, he realized that he needed to protect Washington’s policy of staying out of the French and British war. Because the French helped secure American independence from Britain they had greater popularity with America. After the Jay treaty with Great Britain the French became angry and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British. In order for Adams to avoid war he sent a commission to negotiate an understanding with France. In case the negotiation did not work Adams urged the Congress to augment the navy and army.



Presidential Dollar of John Adams

As President Adams followed Washington's lead in making the presidency the example of republican values and stressing civic virtue, he was never implicated in any scandal. Some historians consider his worst mistake to be keeping the old cabinet, which was controlled by Hamilton, instead of installing his own people, confirming Adams's own admission he was a poor politician because he "was unpractised in intrigues for power."  Ferling (1992) ch 16, p 333.  Yet, there are those historians who feel that Adams retention of Washington's cabinet was a statesman-like step to soothe worries about an orderly succession. As Adams himself explained, "I had then no particular object of any of them."  McCullough p 471  That would soon change.
Adams's combative spirit did not always lend itself to presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: "[As president] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." Ellis (1998) p 57

Adams's four years as president (1797 1801) were marked by intense disputes over foreign policy. Britain and France were at war; Adams and the Federalists favored Britain, while Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans favored France. An undeclared naval war between the U.S. and France, called the Quasi-War, broke out in 1798. The humiliation of the XYZ Affair, in which the French demanded huge bribes before any discussions could begin, led to serious threats of full-scale war with France and embarrassed the Jeffersonians, who were friends to France. The Federalists built up the army under George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, built warships, such as the USS Constitution, and raised taxes. They cracked down on political immigrants and domestic opponents with the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were signed by Adams in 1798.

These Acts were composed of four separate and distinct units:

These 4 acts were brought about to suppress Republican opposition. The Naturalization Act doubled the period required to naturalize the foreign born to American citizenship to 14 years. Since most immigrants voted republican they thought by initiating this act it would decrease the proportion of people who voted republican. 
The Alien Friends Act and the Alien Enemies Act allowed the president to deport any foreigner that he  thought was dangerous to the country. 
The Sedition Act criminalized anyone who publicly criticized the federal government. Some of the punishments included 2-5 years in prison and fines of $2,000 to $5,000. Adams had not designed or promoted any of these acts but he did sign them into law because he had no problem punishing those who abused the government.

Those Acts, and the high-profile prosecution of a number of newspaper editors and one Congressman by the Federalists, became highly controversial. Some historians have noted that the Alien and Sedition Acts were relatively rarely enforced, as only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified and as Adams never signed a deportation order, and that the furor over the Alien and Sedition Acts was mainly stirred up by the Democratic-Republicans. However, other historians emphasize that the Acts were highly controversial from the outset, resulted in many aliens leaving the country voluntarily, and created an atmosphere where opposing the Federalists, even on the floor of Congress, could and did result in prosecution. The election of 1800 became a bitter and volatile battle, with each side expressing extraordinary fear of the other party and its policies.  Ferling (1992) ch 17

The deep division in the Federalist party came on the army issue. Adams was forced to name Washington as commander of the new army, and Washington demanded that Hamilton be given the second position. Adams reluctantly gave in. Major General Hamilton virtually took control of the War department. The rift between Adams and the High Federalists (as Adams's opponents were called) grew wider. The High Federalists refused to consult Adams over the key legislation of 1798; they changed the defense measures which he had called for, demanded that Hamilton control the army, and refused to recognize the necessity of giving key Democratic-Republicans (like Aaron Burr) senior positions in the army (which Adams wanted to do in order to gain some Democratic-Republican support). By building a large standing army the High Federalists raised popular alarms and played into the hands of the Democratic-Republicans. They also alienated Adams and his large personal following. They shortsightedly viewed the Federalist party as their own tool and ignored the need to pull together the entire nation in the face of war with France. Kurtz (1967) yyoaoaoaschwing! p 331

For long stretches, Adams withdrew to his home in Massachusetts. In February 1799, Adams stunned the country by sending diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. Napoleon, realizing the animosity of the United States was doing no good, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States could now be free of foreign entanglements, as Washington advised in his own Farewell Letter. Adams avoided war, but deeply split his own party in the process. He brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army.  Ferling (1992) ch 18




The death of Washington, in 1799, weakened the Federalists, as they lost the one man who symbolized and united the party.  In the presidential election of 1800, Adams ran and lost the electoral vote narrowly. Among the causes of his defeat was distrust of him by "High Federalists" led by Hamilton, the popular disapproval of the Alien and Sedition Acts, the popularity of his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, and the effective politicking of Aaron Burr in New York State, where the legislature (which selected the electoral college) shifted from Federalist to Republican on the basis of a few wards in New York City controlled by Burr's machine.  Ferling (1992) ch 19; Ferling (2004)

In the election of 1800 John Adams and his running mate, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney went against the Republican duo of Jefferson and Burr. Hamilton tried his hardest to sabotage Adams campaign in hopes of boosting Pinckney's chances of winning the presidency. In the end, Adams lost narrowly to Jefferson by 65 to 73 electoral votes.



As his term was expiring, Adams appointed a series of judges, called the "Midnight Judges" because most of them were formally appointed days before the presidential term expired. Most of the judges were eventually unseated when the Jeffersonians abolished their offices. But John Marshall remained, and his long tenure as Chief Justice of the United States represents the most lasting influence of the Federalists, as Marshall refashioned the Constitution into a nationalizing force and established the Judicial Branch as the equal of the Executive and Legislative branches. Ferling (1992) p 409











Adams appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:

Portrait of an elderly John Adams by Gilbert Stuart (1823).
Following his 1800 defeat, Adams retired into private life. Depressed when he left office, he did not attend Jefferson's inauguration.  He went back to farming in the Quincy area.

In 1812, Adams reconciled with Jefferson. Their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, who had been corresponding with both, encouraged Adams to reach out to Jefferson. Adams sent a brief note to Jefferson, which resulted in a resumption of their friendship, and initiated a correspondence which lasted the rest of their lives. Their letters are rich in insight into both the period and the minds of the two Presidents and revolutionary leaders. Their correspondence lasted fourteen years, and consisted of 158 letters.  Cappon (1988)   It was in these years that they two men discussed "natural aristocracy."  Jefferson said that "“The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society.  And indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural aristoi into the offices of government?" Cappon, ed., 387  Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded.  Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. . . . When aristocracies, are established by human laws and honour wealth and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence."  Cappon, ed. 400   It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue.  That being the way of nature, he thought such "talents" were natural.  A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.

Sixteen months before his death, his son, John Quincy Adams, became the sixth President of the United States (1825 1829), the only son of a former President to hold the office until George W. Bush in 2001.

His daughter Abigail ("Nabby") was married to Congressman William Stephens Smith and died of cancer in 1816. His son Charles died as an alcoholic in 1800. His son Thomas and his family lived with Adams and Louisa Smith (Abigail's niece by her brother William) to the end of Adams's life.  Ferling (1992) ch 20

On July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, Adams died at his home in Quincy. His last words are often quoted as "Thomas Jefferson survives." Only the words "Thomas Jefferson" were clearly intelligible among his last, however.  Jefferson Still Survives. Retrieved on 2006-12-26.  Adams was unaware that Jefferson, his great political rival — and later friend and correspondent — had died a few hours earlier on that same day.United First Parish Church The fact that Adams and Jefferson, both of whom had been so instrumental in creating the Declaration of Independence, died on the fiftieth anniversary of the date of its publication, is one of the more remarkable coincidences in history.

His crypt lies at United First Parish Church (also known as the Church of the Presidents) in Quincy.  Until his record was broken by Ronald Reagan in 2001, he was the nation's longest-living President (90 years, 247 days) maintaining that record for 175 years.  The record is currently held by former President Gerald Ford, who served less than one term, and who died December 26, 2006 at 93 years, 165 days.

John Adams remains the longest-lived person ever elected to both of the highest offices in the United States.



Adams was raised a Congregationalist, becoming a Unitarian at a time when most of the Congregational churches around Boston were turning to Unitarianism.  Everett (1966) argues that Adams was not a deist, but he used deistic terms in his speeches and writing. He believed in the essential goodness of the creation, but did not believe in the divinity of Christ or that God intervened in the affairs of individuals. Although not anti-clerical, he advocated the separation of church and state. He also believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. Everett concludes that "Adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness" and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection. Robert B. Everett, "The Mature Religious Thought of John Adams," Proceedings of the South Carolina Historical Association (1966), p 49-57; [ISSN 0361-6207].

Adams often railed against what he saw as overclaiming of authority by the Catholic church. See  TeachingAmericanHistory.org: " A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law", John Adams, 1765

In 1796, Adams denounced the deism of political opponent Thomas Paine, saying, "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will." The Works of John Adams (1854), vol III, p 421, diary entry for July 26, 1796.

The Unitarian Universalist Historical Society sheds some light on Adams’s religious beliefs.    They point out that Adams was clearly no atheist by quoting from his letter to Benjamin Rush, an early promoter of Universalist thought, “I have attended public worship in all countries and with all sects and believe them all much better than no religion, though I have not thought myself obliged to believe all I heard.” The Society also relates how Rush reconciled Adams to his former friend Thomas Jefferson in 1812, after many bitter political battles. This resulted in correspondence between Adams and Jefferson about many topics, including philosophy and religion.  In one of these communications, Adams told Jefferson, "The Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount contain my religion." In another letter, Adams reveals his sincere devotion to God, “My Adoration of the Author of the Universe is too profound and too sincere. The Love of God and his Creation; delight, Joy, Tryumph, Exaltation in my own existence, tho' but an Atom, a molecule Organique, in the Universe, are my religion.” He continues by revealing his Universalist sympathies, rejection of orthodox Christian dogma, and his personal belief that he was a true Christian for not accepting such dogma, “Howl, Snarl, bite, Ye Calvinistick! Ye Athanasian Divines, if You will. Ye will say, I am no Christian: I say Ye are no Christians: and there the Account is ballanced. Yet I believe all the honest men among you, are Christians in my Sense of the Word." The Society also demonstrates that Adams rejected orthodox Christian doctrines of the trinity, predestination, yet equated human understanding and the human conscience to “celestial communication” or personal revelation from God. It is also shown that Adams held a strong conviction in life after death or otherwise, as he explained, “you might be ashamed of your Maker.”

James_Monroe



James Monroe (April 28, 1758 – July 4, 1831) was the fifth President of the United States (1817-1825). His administration was marked by the acquisition of Florida (1819); the Missouri Compromise (1820), in which Missouri was declared a slave state; and the profession of the Monroe Doctrine (1823), declaring U.S. opposition to European interference in the Americas.


The President’s parents, father Spence Monroe (ca. 1727 1774), a woodworker and tobacco farmer, and mother Elizabeth Jones Monroe had significant land holdings but little money. Like his parents, he was a slaveholder. Born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, Monroe went to school at Campbelltown Academy and then the College of William and Mary, both in Virginia.  After graduating from William and Mary in 1776, Monroe fought in the Continental Army, serving with distinction at the Battle of Trenton, where he was shot in his left shoulder. He is depicted holding the flag in the famous painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware. Following his military service, he practiced law in Fredericksburg, Virginia. James Monroe married Elizabeth Kortright on February 16, 1786 at the Trinity Church in New York.

Monroe was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1782 and served in the Continental Congress from 1783 to 1786. As a youthful politician, he joined the anti-Federalists in the Virginia Convention which ratified the Constitution, and in 1790, was elected United States Senator.

After his term in the Senate, Monroe was appointed Minister to France from 1794 to 1796. His appointment there was made difficult as he had strong sympathies for the French Revolution, but dutifully maintained President Washington's strict policy of neutrality between Britiain and France.

Out of office, Monroe returned to practicing law in Virginia until elected governor there, serving from 1799 to 1802.

Under the first Jefferson administration, Monroe was dispatched to France to assist Robert R. Livingston negotiate the Louisiana Purchase. Monroe was then appointed Minister to the Court of St. James (Britain) from 1803 to 1807. In 1806 he negotiated a treaty with Britain to replace the Jay Treaty of 1794, but Jefferson rejected it as unsatisfactory, as the treaty contained no ban on the British practice of impressment of American sailors. As a result, the two nations moved closer toward the War of 1812.

Monroe returned to the Virginia House of Delegates and was elected to another term as governor of Virginia in 1811, but he resigned a few months into the term. He then served as Secretary of State from 1811 to 1814.  When he was appointed to Secretary of War in 1814, he stayed on as the Secretary of State ad interim.  At the war's end in 1815, he was again commissioned as the permanent Secretary of State, and left his position as Secretary of War.  Thus from October 1, 1814 to February 28, 1815, Monroe effectively held the two cabinet posts.  Monroe stayed on as Secretary of State until the end of the James Madison Presidency, and the following day Monroe began his term as the new President of the United States.



Following the War of 1812, Monroe was elected president in the election of 1816, and re-elected in 1820. In both those elections Monroe ran nearly uncontested.  To detail, well prepared on most issues, non-partisan in spirit, and above all pragmatic, Monroe managed his presidential duties well.  He made strong Cabinet choices, naming a southerner, John C. Calhoun, as Secretary of War, and a northerner, John Quincy Adams, as Secretary of State. Only Henry Clay's refusal kept Monroe from adding an outstanding westerner.  Most appointments went to deserving Democratic-Republicans, but he did not try to use them to build the party's base.  Indeed, he allowed the base to decay, which reduced tensions and led to the naming of his era as the "Era of Good Feelings". To build good will, he made two long tours in 1817. Frequent stops allowed innumerable ceremonies of welcome and good will. The Federalist Party dwindled and eventually died out, starting with the Hartford Convention. Practically every politician belonged to the Democratic-Republican Party, but the party lost its vitality and organizational integrity. The party's Congressional caucus stopped meeting, and there were no national conventions.

These "good feelings" endured until 1824, when he executed the controversial Monroe Transfer. Monroe, with his popularity undiminished, followed nationalist policies. Across the commitment to nationalism, sectional cracks appeared. The Panic of 1819 caused a painful economic depression. The application for statehood by the Missouri Territory, in 1819, as a slave state failed. An amended bill for gradually eliminating slavery in Missouri precipitated two years of bitter debate in Congress. The Missouri Compromise bill resolved the struggle, pairing Missouri as a slave state with Maine, a free state, and barring slavery north and west of Missouri forever.

Monroe began to formally recognize the young sister republics (the former Spanish colonies) in 1822. He and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams wished to avoid trouble with Spain until it had ceded the Floridas to the U.S., which was done in 1821.

Monroe is probably best known for the Monroe Doctrine, which he delivered in his message to Congress on December 2, 1823. In it, he proclaimed the Americas should be free from future European colonization and free from European interference in sovereign countries' affairs. It further stated the United States' intention to stay neutral in European wars and wars between European powers and their colonies, but to consider any new colonies or interference with independent countries in the Americas as hostile acts toward the United States.

Britain, with its powerful navy, also opposed re-conquest of Latin America and suggested that the United States join in proclaiming "hands off." Ex-Presidents Jefferson and Madison counseled Monroe to accept the offer, but Secretary Adams advised, "It would be more candid ... to avow our principles explicitly to Russia and France, than to come in as a cock-boat in the wake of the British man-of-war." Monroe accepted Adams' advice. Not only must Latin America be left alone, he warned, but also Russia must not encroach southward on the Pacific coast. "... the American continents," he stated, "by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European Power." Some 20 years after Monroe died in 1831 this became known as the Monroe Doctrine.

Monroe appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:





When his presidency expired on March 4, 1825, James Monroe lived at Monroe Hill on the grounds of the University of Virginia.  This university's modern campus was Monroe's family farm from 1788 to 1817, but he had sold it in the first year of his presidency to the new college.  He served on the college's Board of Visitors under Jefferson and then under the second rector and another former President James Madison, until his death.

Monroe had racked up many debts during his years of public life. As a result, he was forced to sell off his Highland Plantation (now called Ash Lawn-Highland; it is owned by his alma mater, the College of William and Mary, which has opened it to the public). Throughout his life, he was not financially solvent, and his wife's poor health made matters worse.  For these reasons, he and his wife lived in Oak Hill until Elizabeth's death on September 23, 1830.



Upon Elizabeth's death in 1830, Monroe moved to New York City to live with his daughter Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur who had married Samuel L. Gouverneur in the first White House wedding.  Monroe died there from heart failure and tuberculosis on July 4, 1831, becoming the third president to die on the 4th of July. His death came 55 years after the U.S. Declaration of Independence was proclaimed and 5 years after the death of Presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. He was originally buried in New York at the Gouverneur family vault in the New York City Marble Cemetery.  Twenty-seven years later in 1858 he was re-interred to the President's Circle at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

"When it comes to Monroe's ...thoughts on religion", Bliss Isely comments in his The Presidents: Men of Faith, "less is known than that of any other President." He burned much of his correspondence with his wife, and no letters survive in which he might have discussed his religious beliefs. Nor did his friends, family or associates write about his beliefs. Letters that do survive, such as ones written on the occasion of the death of his son, contain no discussion of religion.

Monroe was raised in a family that belonged to the Church of England when it was the state church in Virginia, and as an adult frequently attended Episcopalian churches, though there is no record he ever took communion. He has been classified by some historians as a Deist, and he did use deistic language to refer to God. Jefferson had been attacked as an atheist and infidel for his deistic views, but never Monroe.  Unlike Jefferson, Monroe was not anticlerical. [Holmes 2003]

Abstract: Monroe sparked a constitutional controversy when, in 1817, he sent General Andrew Jackson to move against Spanish Florida in order to pursue hostile Seminoles and punish the Spanish for aiding them. News of Jackson's exploits ignited a congressional investigation of the 1st Seminole War. Dominated by Democratic-Republicans, the 15th Congress was generally expansionist and more likely to support the popular Jackson. Ulterior political agendas of many congressmen dismantled partisan and sectional coalitions, so that Jackson's opponents argued weakly and became easily discredited. After much debate, the House of Representatives voted down all resolutions that condemned Jackson in any way, thus implicitly endorsing Monroe's actions and leaving the issue surrounding the role of the executive with respect to war powers unanswered.

ISSN 0026-2927. Abstract: Analyzes Monroe's concern over untoward foreign influence on the presidency. He was alarmed at Spanish diplomat Diego María de Gardoqui, involving a US attempt to secure the opening of the Mississippi River to American commerce. Here Monroe saw Spain overinfluencing the republic, which could have risked the loss of the Southwest or dominance of the Northeast. Monroe placed faith in a strong presidency and the system of checks and balances. In the 1790s he fretted over an aging George Washington being too heavily influenced by close advisers like Hamilton who was too close to Britain. Monroe opposed the Jay Treaty and was humiliated when Washington criticized for his support of revolutionary France while he was minister to France. He saw foreign and Federalist elements in the genesis of the Quasi War of 1798-1800 and in efforts to keep Thomas Jefferson away from the presidency in 1801. As governor he considered using the Virginia militia to force the outcome in favor of Jefferson. Federalists responded in kind, some seeing Monroe as at best a French dupe and at worst a traitor. Monroe thus contributed to a paranoid style of politics.

Abstract: Assesses Monroe's views on slavery as governor of Virginia from 1799 to 1802, emphasizing Monroe's moderate view of slaveholding during a slave uprising in Southampton County in October 1799. Monroe took pains to see that the charged rebels received proper legal treatment, demonstrating a marked concern for their civil rights. He conducted an exhaustive investigation into the incident and saw to it the slaves involved received a fair trial. Although he opposed abolition, Monroe supported African colonization proposals and gradual, compensated emancipation. When the occasion warranted, as in Gabriel Prosser's rebellion of 1800, Monroe took an unpopular position in supporting fair trials and attempting to explain and justify slave actions. In the final analysis, Monroe believed in the eventual demise of slavery.

Jeffrey Preston Bezos (/ˈbeɪzoʊs/;[a][2] né Jorgensen; born January 12, 1964) is an American industrialist, media proprietor, and investor. He is best known as the founder, CEO, and president of the online retail company Amazon. The first centi-billionaire on the Forbes wealth index, Bezos has been the world's richest person since 2017 and was named the "richest man in modern history" after his net worth increased to $150 billion in July 2018.[3] In September 2018, Forbes described him as "far richer than anyone else on the planet" as he added $1.8 billion to his net worth when Amazon became the second company in history to reach a market cap of $1 trillion.

Born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and later Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. He founded Amazon in late 1994 on a cross-country road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and AI. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, the largest Internet company by revenue, and the world's largest provider of virtual assistants[4] and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services branch.

Bezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. A Blue Origin test flight successfully first reached space in 2015, and the company has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight.[5] He also purchased the major American newspaper The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million in cash, and manages many other investments through his Bezos Expeditions venture capital firm.

Early life

Bezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 12, 1964, the son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Ted Jorgensen.[6] At the time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student and his father was a bike shop owner.[7] After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April 1968.[8] Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to Bezos.[9] The family moved to Houston, Texas, where Mike worked as an engineer for Exxon after he received a degree from the University of New Mexico.[10] Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[11] Bezos' maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[12] Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth.[10] Bezos would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117 ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406 ha).[13][14] His maternal grandmother was Mattie Louise Gise (née Strait), through whom he is a cousin of country singer George Strait.[15]

Bezos often displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency, and he once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[16][17] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School in nearby Pinecrest, Florida.[18][19] While Bezos was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.[20] He attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[21][22] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[21] In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[23] In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[24][25] In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).[26][27]
Business career
Early career

After Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen Consulting, among others.[28] He first worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade.[29] Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter.[30] He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust. He worked there from 1988 to 1990.[30] He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a newly-founded hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling in 1990 and worked there until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president at the age of 30.[30][28]

In late 1993, Bezos decided to establish an online bookstore.[31] He left his job at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in his garage on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle.[32][33] Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[34] He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents and invested in Amazon.[33] He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[35] Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[30][34] Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public offering (IPO).[36] In response to critical reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble.[34]

In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of other consumer goods.[34] Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997 equity offering to finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[34] In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[37] In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic.[34] In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[38] After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[37] In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[39] In November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon Kindle.[40] According to a 2008 Time profile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[41] In 2013, Bezos secured a $600 million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[42] In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[43]

In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[44] On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[45] A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[46] By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin.[47] On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon's Super Bowl commercial.[48] On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2 billion.[49] Due to the growth of Alibaba in China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon into India.[50] On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became the world's wealthiest person over Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates when his estimated net worth increased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world by Forbes on March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[51]
Bezos in 2010

In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company's supply chain routes.[52] Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon–and Bezos, specifically–of sales tax avoidance, misusing postal routes, and anti-competitive business practices.[53] Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[54] Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out of Stanford University indicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[55] During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon's face recognition software, Rekognition.[56] Additionally, statements by the Trump administration, in favor of overturning the antitrust law known as the Paramount Decree, have been predicted to help Amazon acquire the Landmark Theaters chain.[57]

Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receiving corporate welfare.[58] This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers in Arizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, relied on food stamps.[59] While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[60] He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[61] Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[62] However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[63] On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[64] The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour – a decision that was interpreted as support for the Fight for $15 movement.[65]
Blue Origin

In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup company.[66] Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the solar system.[22] He was the valedictorian when he graduated from high school in 1982. His speech was followed up with a Miami Herald interview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[67] The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion.[68]

After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006, when it purchased a large tract of land in West Texas for a launch and test facility.[69] After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing the cost of space travel for humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[70] In September 2011, one of the company's unmanned prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancing spaceflight.[71] In May 2013, Bezos met with Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[72] He has been compared to Branson and Elon Musk as all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[73]

In 2015, Bezos announced that a new orbital launch vehicle was under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[74] Later in November, Blue Origin's New Shepard space vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing a vertical landing back at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[75] He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated with business-related pollution.[76]

In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landed dummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[77] To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[78] Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes to colonize the solar system, and has been selling $1 billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[79][80] In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve the natural resources of Earth by making the human species multi-planetary.[81] He announced that New Shepard would begin transporting humans into sub-orbital space by November 2018.[81] In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[82]
The Washington Post

On August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase of The Washington Post for $250 million in cash.[83] To execute the sale, he established Nash Holdings, a limited liability holding company that legally owns the paper.[84] The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took control.[85] In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change at The Washington Post and lifted the online paywall for subscribers of a number of U.S. local newspapers in Texas, Hawaii, and Minnesota.[86] In January 2016, Bezos set out to reinvent the newspaper as a media and technology company by reconstructing its digital media, mobile platforms, and analytics software.[87] Throughout the early years of ownership, Bezos was accused of having a potential conflict of interest with the paper.[88] Bezos and the newspaper's editorial board have dismissed accusations that he unfairly controlled the paper's content and Bezos maintains the paper's independence.[89][90] After a surge in online readership in 2016, the paper was profitable for the first time since Bezos made the purchase in 2013.[90]
Bezos Expeditions

Bezos makes personal investments through his venture capital vehicle, Bezos Expeditions.[91] He was one of the first shareholders in Google, when he invested $250,000 in 1998. That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3 million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1 billion in 2017.[92][93] He also invested in Unity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[94] Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology, Grail, Juno Therapeutics, and ZocDoc.[95] In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos's role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later named Haven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway.[96][97]

Bezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[98] Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics at Princeton Neuroscience Institute.[99][100] In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of two Saturn V first-stage Rocketdyne F-1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[101] They were positively identified as belonging to the Apollo 11 mission's S-1C stage from July 1969.[102][103] The engine is currently on display at the Seattle Museum of Flight.[104][105]
Public image

Journalist Nellie Bowles of The New York Times has described the public persona and personality of Bezos as that of "a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan".[106] During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense of public charity and social welfare.[106][107] His business practices projected a public image of prudence and parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon. Bezos was a multi-billionaire who hung his clothes on a rack in his Amazon headquarters office and drove a 1996 Honda Accord.[108] Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[109][110][111]

Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[112][113] This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[109] Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrote an unauthorized book that described Bezos as a demanding boss as well as hyper-competitive.[107][112] Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles and externalities.[114][115]

During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to wear tailored clothing; he weight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[116] His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as the metonym of the company.[117][118] His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has been parodied as an enterprising super villain.[119][120][121] Since 2017, he has been portrayed by Kyle Mooney and Steve Carell on Saturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[122] Bezos eats exotic foods, such as octopus and roasted iguana.[123][124][125] In May 2014, the International Trade Union Confederation named Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretary Sharan Burrow saying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model."[126] During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[13] His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[127][13] Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing a New York Times piece.[128][129]
Leadership style
"Day 1" Management Philosophy
Day 1: start up
Day 2: stasis
Day 3: irrelevance
Day 4: "excruciating, painful decline"
Day 5: death

Bezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe his growth mindset.[130][131]

Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked at D. E. Shaw and again during the early years of Amazon.[132] He described this life philosophy by stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[132] During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[133] To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed the mantra "Get Big Fast", which spoke to the company's need to scale its operations and establish market dominance.[34] He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form of dividends.[109]

Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard work–life balance because he believes balance implies that you can have one and not the other.[134] He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[134] Journalist Walt Mossberg dubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[135] Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule–a preference for meetings to be small enough to where two pizzas can feed everyone in the board room.[136] When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise the common standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[137]

He meets with Amazon investors for a total of only six hours a year.[136] Instead of using PowerPoints, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[138] Starting in 1998, Bezos publishes an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers not competitors, take risks for market leadership, facilitate staff morale, build a company culture, and empower people.[139][140] Bezos maintains the email address "jeff@amazon.com" as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company.[141] Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[141] Bezos has cited Warren Buffett (of Berkshire Hathaway), Jamie Dimon (of JPMorgan Chase), and Bob Iger (of Walt Disney) as major influences on his leadership style.[142]
Recognition

    In 1999, Bezos received his first major award when Time named him Person of the Year.[143]
    In 2008, he was selected by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's best leaders.[144]
    Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology from Carnegie Mellon University in 2008.[145]
    In 2011, The Economist gave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for the Amazon Kindle.[146]
    In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year by Fortune.[147]
    He is also a member of the Bilderberg Group and attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference in St. Moritz, Switzerland,[148] and the 2013 conference in Watford, Hertfordshire, England. He was a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012.[149]
    In 2014, he was ranked the best-performing CEO in the world by Harvard Business Review.[150]
    He has also figured in Fortune's list of 50 great leaders of the world for three straight years, topping the list in 2015.[151]
    In September 2016, Bezos received a $250,000 prize for winning the Heinlein Prize for Advances in Space Commercialization, which he donated to the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.[152]
    In February 2018, Bezos was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for "leadership and innovation in space exploration, autonomous systems, and building a commercial pathway for human space flight".[153]
    In March 2018, at the Explorers Club annual dinner, he was awarded the Buzz Aldrin Space Exploration Award in recognition of his work with Blue Origin.[123]
    He received Germany's 2018 Axel Springer Award for Business Innovation and Social Responsibility.[154] Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in their 2018 listing.[155]

Additional reference(s): Bloomberg Billionaires Index

Bezos first became a millionaire in 1997 after raising $54 million through Amazon's initial public offering (IPO).[156] He was first included on the Forbes World's Billionaires list in 1999 with a registered net worth of $10.1 billion.[157] His net worth decreased to $6.1 billion a year later, a 40.5% drop.[158] His wealth plummeted even more the following year, dropping 66.6% to $2.0 billion.[159] He lost $500 million the following year, which brought his net worth down to $1.5 billion.[160] The following year, his net worth increased by 104% to $2.5 billion.[161] From 2005 to 2007, he quadrupled his net worth to $8.7 billion.[162] After the financial crisis and succeeding economic recession, his net worth would decrease to $6.8 billion—a 17.7% drop.[163][164] His wealth rose by 85.2% in 2010, leaving him with $12.6 billion. This percentage increase ascended him to the 43rd spot on the ranking from 68th.[163][165]

After a rumor broke out that Amazon was developing a smartphone, Bezos's net worth rose to $30.5 billion in 2014.[166][167] A year later, Bezos entered the top ten when he increased his net worth to a total of $50.3 billion.[168] Bezos rose to be the 5th richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7 billion in one hour.[168] By the time the Forbes list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2 billion.[169] However, just months later in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2 billion to $66.5 billion unofficially ranking him the third richest person in the world behind Warren Buffett.[170] After sporadic jumps in Amazon's share price, in July 2017 he briefly unseated Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.[171]
The net worth of Jeff Bezos from 1999 to 2018 as estimated by Forbes magazine, in the nominal U.S. dollar. His net worth is calculated in the billions by March of each year.

Bezos would continue to sporadically surpass Gates throughout the month of October 2017 after Amazon's share price fluctuated.[172] His net worth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, after Amazon's share price increased by more than 2.5%.[173] When the 2017 list was issued, Bezos's net worth was registered at $72.8 billion, adding $27.6 billion from the previous year.[174] Bezos was officially ranked as the third wealthiest person in the world up from the 5th spot in 2016.[174] His wealth's rapid growth from 2016 to 2017 sparked a variety of assessments about how much money Bezos earned on a controlled, reduced time scale. On October 10, 2017, he made an estimated $6.24 billion in 5 minutes, slightly less than the annual Gross Domestic Product of Kyrgyzstan.[175]

On March 6, 2018, Bezos was officially designated the wealthiest person in the world with a registered net worth of $112 billion.[176] He unseated Bill Gates ($90 billion) who was $6 billion ahead of Warren Buffett ($84 billion), ranked third.[177] He is considered the first registered centi-billionaire (not adjusted for inflation).[c]

His wealth, in 2017–18 terms, equaled that of 2.7 million Americans.[183] Bezos's net worth increased by $33.6 billion from January 2017 to January 2018. This increase outstripped the economic development (in GDP terms) of more than 96 countries around the world.[184] During March 9, Bezos earned $230,000 every 60 seconds.[185] The Motley Fool estimated that if Bezos had not sold any of his shares from its original public offering in 1997, his net worth would sit at $181 billion in 2018.[186] According to Quartz, his net worth of $150 billion in July 2018 was enough to purchase the entire stock markets of Nigeria, Hungary, Egypt, Luxembourg, and Iran.[187] Following the report by Quartz, Amazon workers in Poland, (Germany), and Spain participated in demonstrations and labor strikes to draw attention to his growing wealth and the lack of compensation, labor rights, and satisfactory working conditions of select Amazon workers.[188] On July 17, 2018 he was designated the "wealthiest person in modern history"[d] by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,[191] Fortune,[192] MarketWatch,[193] The Wall Street Journal,[194] and Forbes.[190]

In 2019, Bezos's wealth was reduced by his divorce from his wife MacKenzie Bezos.[195][196] According to Forbes, had the Washington state common law applied to their divorce without a prenuptial agreement, Bezos's wealth could have been equitably divided with his ex-wife,[197][198] however she eventually received 25% of Bezos's Amazon shares, valued at approximately $36 billion, making her the third richest woman in the world. Bezos retained his interest in The Washington Post and Blue Origin, as well as voting control of the shares received by his ex-wife.[199]

In June 2019, Bezos purchased three adjoining apartments overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan, including a penthouse, for a combined total of US$80 million, making this one of the most expensive real estate purchases within New York City in 2019.[200]

In February 2020, Bezos purchased the Warner Estate from David Geffen for $165 million,[201][202] a record price paid for a residence in the Los Angeles area. The previous record high price of $150 million was paid by Lachlan Murdoch.[201] During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was reported that Bezos' fortune had grown by $24bn, citing a surge in demand from households on lockdown shopping on Amazon.[203]
Personal life

In 1992, Bezos was working for D. E. Shaw in Manhattan when he met novelist MacKenzie Tuttle, who was a research associate at the firm; the couple married a year later.[30][204] In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon.[205] Bezos and his now ex-wife MacKenzie are the parents of four children: three sons, and one daughter adopted from China.[68][206]

In March 2003, Bezos was one of three passengers in a helicopter that crashed in West Texas after the craft's tail boom hit a tree.[207] Bezos sustained minor injuries and was discharged from a local hospital the same day.[25]

In 2016, Bezos played a Starfleet official in the movie Star Trek Beyond, and joined the cast and crew at a San Diego Comic-Con screening.[208] He had lobbied Paramount for the role and apropos of Alexa and his personal/professional interest in speech recognition. His one line consisted of a response to an alien in distress: "Speak Normally." In his initial discussion of the project which became Alexa with his technical advisor Greg Hart in 2011, Bezos told him that the goal was to create "the Star Trek computer." [209]

On January 9, 2019, Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, announced on Twitter their intent to divorce after a "long period" of separation.[210][211][212] On April 4, 2019, the divorce was finalized, with Bezos keeping 75% of the couple's Amazon stock and MacKenzie getting the remaining 25% ($35.6 billion) in Amazon stock. However, Bezos would keep all of the couple's voting rights.[213]

On February 7, 2019, Bezos published an online essay in which he accused American Media, Inc. owner David Pecker of "extortion and blackmail" for threatening to publish intimate photos of Bezos and Lauren Sánchez, if he did not stop his investigation into how his text messages and other photos had been leaked to the National Enquirer.[214][215]
Politics

According to public campaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns of Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, two Democratic U.S. senators from Washington. He has also supported U.S. representative John Conyers, as well as Patrick Leahy and Spencer Abraham, U.S. senators serving on committees dealing with Internet-related issues.[216] Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos have supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, and in 2012 contributed $2.5 million to Washington United for Marriage, a group supporting a yes vote on Washington Referendum 74, which affirmed a same-sex marriage law enacted in the state.[217] Bezos donated $100,000 towards a movement against a Washington state income tax in 2010 for "top earners." [216] In 2012, he donated to Amazon's political action committee (PAC),[216] which has given $56,000 and $74,500 to Democrats and Republicans, respectively.[218]

After the 2016 presidential election, Bezos was invited to join Donald Trump's Defense Innovation Advisory Board, an advisory council to improve the technology used by the Defense Department. Bezos declined the offer without further comment.[42][219] Trump has repeatedly attacked Bezos via Twitter, accused Bezos of avoiding corporate taxes, gaining undue political influence, and undermining his presidency by spreading "fake news."[220][221] Bezos has repeatedly joked about using his rocket company to send Donald Trump into outer space.[222][223]

In 2014, Amazon won a bid for a cloud computing contract with the CIA valued at $600 million.[224] A 2018, $10 billion contract known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project, this time with the Pentagon, was allegedly written up in a way that favors Amazon.[225] Controversy over this was raised when General James Mattis accepted a headquarters tour invitation from Bezos and co-ordinated the deal through Sally Donnelly, a lobbyist who previously worked for Amazon.[226] In November 2019, when the contract was awarded to Microsoft instead, Amazon filed a lawsuit with allegations that the bidding process was biased.[227][228] Despite Bezos's support for an open borders policy towards immigrants, Amazon has actively marketed facial recognition software to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[229]

In 2019, a political action committee linked to Bezos spent over $1 million in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat activist Kshama Sawant in Seattle's city council election.[230]
Saudi hacking claim
See also: Jamal Khashoggi and Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi

In March 2018, Bezos met in Seattle with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[231] In March 2019, Bezos's security consultant accused the Saudi government of hacking Bezos's phone. According to BBC, Bezos's top security staffer, Gavin de Becker, "linked the hack to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul." Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at the Washington Post, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey's Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.[232]

On January 2020, The Guardian reported that hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in the Washington Post. Forensic analysis of Bezos's mobile phone conducted by advisory firm FTI Consulting, concluded it "highly probable" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in a WhatsApp message to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on May 1, 2018.[233][234] Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.[235]
Philanthropy
Bezos funded the retrieval of these F-1 engine parts from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in 2015, eventually donating them to the Seattle Museum of Flight. They are from Apollo 16 (above) and Apollo 12 (below).

Bezos donated to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center several times between 2009 and 2017.[236] In 2013, he pledged $500,000 to Worldreader, a non-profit founded by a former Amazon employee.[237]

In September 2018, Business Insider reported that Bezos was the only one of the top five billionaires in the world who had not signed the Giving Pledge, an initiative created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that encourages wealthy people to give away a majority of their wealth.[238] That same month, Janet Camarena, director of transparency initiatives at Foundation Center, was quoted by CNBC as having questions about Bezos’ new fund, including the fund's structure and how exactly it will be funded.[239]

On May 23, 2017, Bezos gave $1 million to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides pro bono legal services for American journalists.[240] On June 15, 2017, he posted a message on Twitter asking for ideas for philanthropy: "I'm thinking about a philanthropy strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time—working on the long term".[13] At the time of the post, Bezos's lifetime spending on charitable causes was estimated to be $100 million.[13] Multiple journalists responded by asking Bezos to pay higher wages to Amazon warehouse workers.[241][242] A year later in June, he tweeted that he would announce two philanthropic foci by the end of summer 2018.[243] Bezos announced in September 2018 that he would commit approximately $2 billion to a fund to deal with American homelessness and establish a network of non-profit preschools for low income communities.[244] As part of this announcement, he committed to establishing the "Day 1 Families Fund" to finance "night shelters and day care centers for homeless families" and the "Day 1 Academies Fund" for early childhood education.[245][246]

In January 2018, Bezos made a $33 million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors.[247] In June 2018, Bezos donated to Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private philanthropic fund founded by Bill Gates aimed at promoting emissions-free energy.[248] In September 2018, Bezos donated $10 million to With Honor, a nonpartisan organization that works to increase the number of veterans in political office.[249]

On February 17, 2020, Jeff Bezos pledged $10 billion to combat climate change through the Bezos Earth Fund.[250] Bezos also donated $100 million to food banks through Feeding America during the COVID-19 pandemic; critics pointed out that this represented less than 0.1% of his fortune during a time Amazon was seeing growth in sales.[251][252][253]

Notes

BAY-zohss
All currency figures expressed in the United States dollar (US$) in nominal terms.
Although Bill Gates momentarily surpassed the $100 billion net worth mark in April 1999 before the Dot-com bubble,[178] Bezos was the first to register $100 billion with major wealth indexes and has retained the wealth for longer than Gates's three weeks.[179][180][181][182]

    Many calculations of Bezos's wealth during the late 2010s were not adjusted for inflation. When he was designated the "world wealthiest person" on March 6, 2018, the Forbes The World's Billionaires list stipulated that although Bezos was the first centi-billionaire (i.e. +US$100 billion in net worth), it was Bill Gates who had the most money when taken in real terms.[189] In such terms, Gates had $150 billion while Bezos had $100 billion. However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150 billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[190]

Isaac Newton



Sir Isaac Newton FRS ( ) (4 January 1643 – March 31 1727)   [  OS: December 25 1642 – March 20 1727 ]    was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, and alchemist. His treatise Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries and is the basis for modern engineering.  He showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation, thus removing the last doubts about heliocentrism and advancing the scientific revolution.

In mechanics, Newton enunciated the principles of conservation of momentum and angular momentum. In optics, he invented the reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into a visible spectrum.  He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound.

In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the calculus. He also demonstrated the generalized binomial theorem, developed the so-called "Newton's method" for approximating the zeroes of a function, and contributed to the study of power series.

In a 2005 poll of the Royal Society of who had the greatest effect on the history of science, Newton was deemed more influential than Albert Einstein.




Newton in a 1702 portrait by Godfrey Kneller. Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643   [ OS: December 25, 1642 ]    at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted the latest papal calendar and therefore his date of birth was recorded as Christmas Day, December 25, 1642. Newton was born three months after the death of his father. Born prematurely, he was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and held some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19:  Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them. Cohen, I.B. (1970). Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Vol. 11, p.43. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons

Newton may have suffered from Asperger syndrome, a form of autism.

According to E.T. Bell and H. Eves:
 Newton began his schooling in the village schools and was later sent to The King's School, Grantham, where he became the top student in the school. At King's, he lodged with the local apothecary, William Clarke and eventually became engaged to the apothecary's stepdaughter, Anne Storer, before he went off to the University of Cambridge at the age of 19. As Newton became engrossed in his studies, the romance cooled and Miss Storer married someone else. It is said he kept a warm memory of this love, but Newton had no other recorded "sweet-hearts" and never married.

There are a rumours that he remained a virgin.  Book Review Isaac Newton biography December 2003  However, Bell and Eves' sources for this claim, William Stukeley and Mrs. Vincent (the former Miss Storer   actually named Katherine, not Anne), merely say that Newton entertained "a passion" for Storer while he lodged at the Clarke house.

From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He was removed from school, and by October 1659, he was to be found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed by now for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. He was, by later reports of his contemporaries, thoroughly unhappy with the work. It appears to have been Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, who persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. This he did at the age of eighteen, achieving an admirable final report.

In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge. At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo, Copernicus and Kepler. In 1665, he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that would later become calculus. Soon after Newton had obtained his degree in April of 1665, the University closed down as a precaution against the Great Plague. For the next 2 years, Newton worked at his home in Woolsthorpe on calculus, optics and the law of gravitation.




Isaac Newton (Bolton, Sarah K. Famous Men of Science. NY: Thomas Y. Crowell & Co., 1889)



Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz had developed calculus independently, using their own unique notations. According to Newton's inner circle, Newton had worked out his method years before Leibniz, yet he published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704. Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. Moreover, Leibniz's notation and "differential Method" were universally adopted on the Continent, and after 1820 or so, in the British Empire. Whereas Leibniz's notebooks show the advancement of the ideas from early stages until maturity, there is only the end product in Newton's known notes. Newton claimed that he had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared being mocked for it . Newton had a very close relationship with Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, who from the beginning was impressed by Newton's gravitational theory. In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never finished it. Some of Newton's biographers have suggested that the relationship may have been romantic.  Biography of Isaac Newton at  www.knittingcircle.org.uk   However, in 1694 the relationship between the two men cooled down. At the time, Duillier had also exchanged several letters with Leibniz.

Starting in 1699, other members of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the dispute broke out in full force in 1711. Newton's Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labeled Leibniz a fraud. This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy, which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.

Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula), and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. He also discovered a new formula for calculating pi.

He was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669. In that day, any fellow of Cambridge or Oxford had to be an ordained Anglican priest. However, the terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.




From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into a spectrum of colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. 
A replica of Newton's 6-inch reflecting telescope of 1672 for the Royal Society.
He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties, by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects.  Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus the colours we observe are the result of how objects interact with the incident already-coloured light, not the result of objects generating the colour. For more details, see Newton's theory of colour.

From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. The two men remained enemies until Hooke's death.

Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of wave-particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the theosophist Henry More, revived his interest in alchemy. He replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. John Maynard Keynes, who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that "Newton was not the first of the age of reason: he was the last of the magicians."    Newton's interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science.   notes that Newton apparently abandoned his alchemical researches.  (This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.) Had he not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity. (See also Isaac Newton's occult studies.)

In 1704 Newton wrote Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?"   quoting Opticks   Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe (Optics, 8th Query).

In 1677, Newton returned to his work on mechanics, i.e., gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets, with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and consulting with Hooke and Flamsteed on the subject. He published his results in De Motu Corporum (1684). This contained the beginnings of the laws of motion that would inform the Principia.

The Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (now known as the Principia) was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work Newton stated the three universal laws of motion that were not to be improved upon for more than two hundred years. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the force that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation. In the same work he presented the first analytical determination, based on Boyle's law, of the speed of sound in air.

With the Principia, Newton became internationally recognised. He acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, with whom he formed an intense relationship that lasted until 1693. The end of this friendship led Newton to a nervous breakdown.




Isaac Newton in 1712. Portrait by Sir James Thornhill.

In the 1690s Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal interpretation of the Bible. Henry More's belief in the universe and rejection of Cartesian dualism may have influenced Newton's religious ideas. A manuscript he sent to John Locke in which he disputed the existence of the Trinity was never published. Later works — The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended (1728) and Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John (1733) — were published after his death. He also devoted a great deal of time to alchemy (see above).

Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701, but his only recorded comments were to complain about a cold draft in the chamber and request that the window be closed.

Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat treading on the toes of Master Lucas (and securing the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon Lucas' death in 1699, a position Newton held until his death.  These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising his power to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters. As Master of the Mint in 1717 Newton unofficially moved the Pound Sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard by creating a relationship between gold coins and the silver penny in the "Law of Queen Anne"; these were all great reforms at the time, adding considerably to the wealth and stability of England.  It was his work at the Mint, rather than his earlier contributions to science, that earned him a knighthood from Queen Anne in 1705.
Newton's grave in Westminster Abbey
Newton was made President of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Académie des Sciences. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed's star catalogue, which Newton had used in his studies.

Newton died in London on March 31, 1727   [ OS: March 20, 1727 ]   , and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His half-niece, Catherine Barton Conduitt, Westfall 1980, p. 44.  served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on Jermyn Street in London; he was her "very loving Uncle," Westfall 1980, p. 595  according to his letter to her when she was recovering from smallpox.  Although Newton, who had no children, had divested much of his estate onto relatives in his last years he actually died intestate.

After his death, Newton's body was discovered to have had massive amounts of mercury in it, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.




Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, "Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done."

His scientific fame notwithstanding, Newton's studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy.  Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture. He also placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date. John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew, v. 1, pp. 382–402 after narrowing the years to 30 or 33, provisionally judges 30 most likely.  He also attempted, unsuccessfully, to find hidden messages within the Bible (see Bible code).

Newton may have rejected the church's doctrine of the Trinity. In a minority view, T.C. Pfizenmaier argues that he more likely held the Eastern Orthodox view of the Trinity rather than the Western one held by Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and most Protestants.    In his own day, he was also accused of being a Rosicrucian (as were many in the Royal Society and in the court of Charles II).

In his own lifetime, Newton wrote more on religion than he did on natural science. He believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the hylozoism implicit in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza. Thus, the ordered and dynamically informed universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason, but this universe, to be perfect and ordained, had to be regular.



"Newton," by William Blake; here, Newton is depicted as a "divine geometer"
Newton and Robert Boyle’s mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians.    Thus, the clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism,    and, at the same time, the second wave of English deists used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a "Natural Religion."

The attacks made against pre-Enlightenment "magical thinking," and the mystical elements of Christianity, were given their foundation with Boyle’s mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle’s ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.    Newton refashioned the world governed by an interventionist God into a world crafted by a God that designs along rational and universal principles.    These principles were available for all people to discover, allowed people to pursue their own aims fruitfully in this life, not the next, and to perfect themselves with their own rational powers.

Newton saw God as the master creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation.

Webb, R.K. ed. Knud Haakonssen. “The emergence of Rational Dissent.” Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in eighteenth-century Britain. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1996. p19.  But the unforeseen theological consequence of his conception of God, as Leibniz pointed out, was that God was now entirely removed from the world’s affairs, since the need for intervention would only evidence some imperfection in God’s creation, something impossible for a perfect and omnipotent creator.  Westfall, Richard S. Science and Religion in Seventeenth-Century England. p201.  Leibniz's theodicy cleared God from the responsibility for "l'origine du mal" by making God removed from participation in his creation. The understanding of the world was now brought down to the level of simple human reason, and humans, as Odo Marquard argued, became responsible for the correction and elimination of evil. Marquard, Odo. "Burdened and Disemburdened Man and the Flight into Unindictability," in Farewell to Matters of Principle. Robert M. Wallace trans. London: Oxford UP, 1989.

On the other hand, latitudinarian and Newtonian ideas taken too far resulted in the millenarians, a religious faction dedicated to the concept of a mechanical universe, but finding in it the same enthusiasm and mysticism that the Enlightenment had fought so hard to extinguish. Jacob, Margaret C. The Newtonians and the English Revolution: 1689–1720. p100–101.




In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible, he estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this he said, "This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail."



As warden of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20% of the coins taken in during The Great Recoinage were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convictions of the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult to achieve; however, Newton proved to be equal to the task.

He gathered much of that evidence himself, disguised, while he hung out at bars and taverns. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton was made a justice of the peace and between June 1698 and Christmas 1699 conducted some 200 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers and suspects. Newton won his convictions and in February 1699, he had ten prisoners waiting to be executed.

Possibly Newton's greatest triumph as the king's attorney was against William Chaloner. One of Chaloner's schemes was to set up phony conspiracies of Catholics and then turn in the hapless conspirators whom he entrapped. Chaloner made himself rich enough to posture as a gentleman. Petitioning Parliament, Chaloner accused the Mint of providing tools to counterfeiters (a charge also made by others). He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the Mint's processes in order to improve them. He petitioned Parliament to adopt his plans for a coinage that could not be counterfeited, while at the same time striking false coins. Newton was outraged, and went about the work to uncover anything about Chaloner. During his studies, he found that Chaloner was engaged in counterfeiting. He immediately put Chaloner on trial, but Mr Chaloner had friends in high places, and to Newton's horror, Chaloner walked free. Newton put him on trial a second time with conclusive evidence. Chaloner was convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered on March 23 1699 at Tyburn gallows. Westfall 1980, pp. 571–5



Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of Nature and Natural Law to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded. Cassels, Alan. Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World. p2.

It was Newton’s conception of the universe based upon Natural and rationally understandable laws that became the seed for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of Natural Law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied Natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems and the sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into Natural models of progress.  Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.




The famous three laws of motion:
# Newton's First Law (also known as the Law of Inertia) states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and that an object in uniform motion tends to stay in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.
# Newton's Second Law states that an applied force,   F  , on an object equals the time rate of change of its momentum,   p  . Mathematically, this is written as   \vec F = \frac{d\vec p}{dt} \, = \, \frac{d}{dt} (m \vec v) \, = \, \vec v \, \frac{dm}{dt} + m \, \frac{d\vec v}{dt} \,.    Assuming the mass to be constant, the first term vanishes. Defining the acceleration to be  \vec a \ =\  d\vec v/dt   results in the famous equation   \vec F = m \, \vec a \,  which states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to its mass. In the MKS system of measurement, mass is given in kilograms, acceleration in metres per second squared, and force in newtons (named in his honour).
# Newton's Third Law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.



A reputed descendant of Newton's apple tree, found in the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge.

A popular story claims that Newton was inspired to formulate his theory of universal gravitation by the fall of an apple from a tree.  Cartoons have gone further to suggest the apple actually hit Newton's head, and that its impact somehow made him aware of the force of gravity.  John Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton's niece, described the event when he wrote about Newton's life:

The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it "universal gravitation".

A contemporary writer, William Stukeley, recorded in his Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, in which Newton recalled "when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. It was occasioned by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself. Why should it not go sideways or upwards, but constantly to the earth's centre." In similar terms, Voltaire wrote in his Essay on Epic Poetry (1727), "Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree." These accounts are probably exaggerations of Newton's own tale about sitting by a window in his home (Woolsthorpe Manor) and watching an apple fall from a tree.

Various trees are claimed to be "the" apple tree which Newton describes. The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later, the staff of the [now] National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale  /ref> can supply grafts from their tree (ref 1948-729), which appears identical to Flower of Kent, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.



* Short Chronicle, The System of the World, Optical Lectures, The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms, Amended and De mundi systemate were published posthumously in 1728.




French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange often said that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that he was also "the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish." Fred L. Wilson, History of Science: Newton citing: Delambre, M. "Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de M. le comte J. L. Lagrange," Oeuvres de Lagrange I. Paris, 1867, p. xx.  English poet Alexander Pope was moved by Newton's accomplishments to write the famous epitaph:

Newton himself was rather more modest of his own achievements, famously writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676

Historians generally think the above quote was an attack on Hooke (who was short and hunchbacked), rather than - or in addition to - a statement of modesty. The two were in a dispute over optical discoveries at the time. The latter interpretation also fits with many of his other disputes over his discoveries - such as the question of who discovered calculus as discussed above.

And then in a memoir later

James_Watt



James Watt (January 19 1736   August 19 1819) was a Scottish inventor and engineer whose improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.




James Watt was born on 19th of January, 1736 in Greenock, a seaport on the Firth of Clyde. His father was a shipwright, ship owner and contractor, while his mother, Agnus Muirhead, came from a distinguished family and was well educated. Both were Presbyterians and strong Covenanters.

Watt attended school irregularly but instead he was mostly schooled at home by his mother. He exhibited great manual dexterity and an aptitude for mathematics, while Latin and Greek left him cold, and he absorbed the legends and lore of the Scottish people.

When he was 17, his mother died and his father's health had begun to fail.  Watt travelled to London to study instrument-making for a year, then returned to Scotland   to Glasgow   intent on setting up his own instrument-making business. However, because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice, the Glasgow Guild of Hammermen (any artisans using hammers) blocked his application, despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in Scotland.

Watt was saved from this impasse by three professors of the University of Glasgow, who offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university. It was established in 1758 and one of the professors, the physicist and chemist Joseph Black, became Watt's friend.

In 1764, Watt married his cousin Margaret Miller, with whom he had five children, two of whom lived to adulthood.  She died in childbirth in 1772. In 1777 he married again, to Ann MacGregor, daughter of a Glasgow dye-maker, who survived him. She died in 1832.

Watt had a brother by the name of John. He was shipwrecked when James was 17.

Four years after opening his shop, Watt began to experiment with steam after his friend, Professor John Robison, called his attention to it.  At this point Watt had still never seen an operating steam engine, but he tried constructing a model.  It failed to work satisfactorily, but he continued his experiments and began to read everything about it he could.  He independently discovered the importance of latent heat in understanding the engine, which, unknown to him, Black had famously discovered some years before.  He learned that the University owned a model Newcomen engine, but it was in London for repairs.  Watt got the university to have it returned, and he made the repairs in 1763.  It too just barely worked, and after much experimentation he showed that about 80% of the heat of the steam was consumed in heating the cylinder, because the steam in it was condensed by an injected stream of cold water. His critical insight, to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston, and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam, came finally in 1765 and he soon had a working model.

Now came a long struggle to produce a full-scale engine.  This required more capital, some of which came from Black.  More substantial backing came from John Roebuck, the founder of the celebrated Carron Iron Works, near Falkirk, with whom he now formed a partnership.  But the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder.  Iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than machinists, so the results left much to be desired.  Much capital was spent in pursuing the ground-breaking patent, which in those days required an act of parliament.  Strapped for resources, Watt was forced to take up employment as a surveyor for eight years.  Roebuck went bankrupt, and Matthew Boulton, who owned the Soho foundry works near Birmingham, acquired his patent rights.  Watt and Boulton formed a hugely successful partnership (Boulton & Watt), which lasted for the next twenty-five years.

Watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world. The difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by John Wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at Bersham, near Wrexham, North Wales. Finally, in 1776, the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises. These first engines were used for pumps and produced only reciprocating motion.  Orders began to pour in and for the next five years Watt was very busy installing more engines, mostly in Cornwall for pumping water out of mines.

The field of application of the invention was greatly widened only after Boulton urged Watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding, weaving and milling.  Although a crank seemed the logical and obvious solution to the conversion Watt and Boulton were stymied by a patent for this, whose holder, James Pickard, and associates proposed to cross-license the external condensor.  Watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in 1781.

Over the next six years, he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine.  A double acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one.  A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a centrifugal governor to keep it from "running away" were very important.  He described methods for working the steam expansively.  A compound engine, which connected two or more engines was described.  Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782.  Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented.  One of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a trade secret.  Another important invention, one of which Watt was most proud of, was the Parallel motion / three-bar linkage which was especially important in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves in a circular arc. This was patented in 1784. These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the Newcomen engine.

Because of the danger of exploding boilers and the ongoing issues with leaks, Watt was opposed from the first to the use of high pressure steam--all of his engines used steam at very low pressure.

In 1794 the partners established Boulton and Watt to exclusively manufacture steam engines, and this became a large enterprise.  By 1824 it had produced 1164 steam engines having a total nominal horsepower of about 26,000. Carnegie, p 195    Boulton proved to be an excellent businessman, and both men eventually made fortunes.




Watt was an enthusiastic inventor, with a fertile imagination that sometimes got in the way of finishing his works, because he could always see "just one more improvement."  He was skilled with his hands, and was also able to perform systematic scientific measurements that could quantify the improvements he made and produce a greater understanding of the phenomenon he was working 
with.

Watt was a gentleman, greatly respected by other prominent men of the Industrial Revolution. He was an important member of the Lunar Society, and was a much sought after conversationalist and companion, always interested in expanding his horizons.  He was a rather poor businessman, and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to utilize the steam engine.  Until he retired, he was always much concerned about his financial affairs, and was something of a worrier. His personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and long-lasting.



Watt retired in 1800, the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with Boulton expired. The famous partnership was transferred to the men's sons, Matthew Boulton and James Watt Jr. William Murdoch was made a partner and the firm prospered.

Watt continued to invent other things before and during his semi-retirement. He invented a new method of measuring distances by telescope, a device for copying letters, improvements in the oil lamp, a steam mangle and a machine for copying sculptures.

He and his second wife travelled to France and Germany, and he purchased an estate in Wales, which he much improved.

He died in his home "Heathfield" in Handsworth, Staffordshire on August 19 1819 at the age of 83.



As with many major inventions, there is some dispute as to whether Watt was the original sole inventor of some of the numerous inventions he patented. There is no dispute, however, that he was the sole inventor of his most important invention, the separate condenser.  It was his practice (from around the 1780s) to pre-empt others' ideas which were known to him by filing patents with the intention of securing credit for the invention for himself, and ensuring that no one else was able to practice it. As he states in a letter to Boulton of August 17 1784: 

Some argue that his prohibitions on his employee William Murdoch from working with high pressure steam on his steam locomotive experiments delayed its development. Watt, with his partner Matthew Boulton, battled against rival engineers such as Jonathan Hornblower who tried to develop engines which did not fall foul of his patents.

Watt patented the  application of the sun and planet gear to steam in 1781 and a steam locomotive in 1784, both of which have strong claims to have been invented by his employee, William Murdoch.  Watt himself described the provenance of the invention of the sun and planet gear in a letter to Boulton from Watt dated January 5 1782:
The patent was never contested by Murdoch, who remained an employee of Boulton and Watt for most of his life, and Boulton and Watt's firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines, even long after the patent for the crank expired in 1794.



James Watt's improved steam engine transformed the Newcomen engine, which had hardly changed for fifty years, into a source of power that transformed the world of work, and was the key innovation that brought forth the Industrial Revolution.  The importance of the invention can hardly be overstated--it gave us the modern world.  A key feature of it was that it brought the engine out of the remote coal fields into factories where many mechanics, engineers, and even tinkerers were exposed to its virtues and limitations.  It was a platform for generations of inventors to improve.  It was clear to many that higher pressures produced in improved boilers would produce engines having even higher efficiency, and would lead to the revolution in transportation that was soon embodied in the locomotive and steamboat.  It made possible the construction of new factories that, since they were not dependent on water power, could work the year round, and could be placed almost anywhere.  Work was moved out of the cottages, resulting in economies of scale.  Capital could work more efficiently, and manufacturing productivity greatly improved.  It made possible the cascade of new sorts of  machine tools that could be used to produce better machines, including that most remarkable of all of them, the Watt steam engine.
Watt celebrated as a statue in Chamberlain Square, outside Birmingham Central Library



Watt was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Society of London.  He was a member of the Batavian Society, and one of only eight Foreign Associates of the French Academy of Sciences.



Watt was buried in the grounds of St. Mary's Church, Handsworth, in Birmingham. Later expansion of the church, over his grave, means that his tomb is now buried inside the church.  A statue of him, Boulton and Murdoch is in Birmingham, as are two other statues of him alone, one in Chamberlain Square, the other outside the Law Courts. He is also remembered by the Moonstones and a school is named in his honour, both in Birmingham. An extensive archive of his papers is held at Birmingham Central Library. Matthew Boulton's home, Soho House, is now a museum, commemorating the work of both men. The University of Glasgow's Faculty of Engineering, the oldest in the United Kingdom, (where Watt was a professor) has its headquarters in the James Watt Building, which also houses the department of Mechanical Engineering and the department of Aerospace Engineering.

The location of James Watt's birth in Greenock is commemorated by a statue, close to his birthplace. Several locations and street names in Greenock recall him, most notably the Watt Memorial Library, which was begun in 1816 with Watt's donation of scientific books, and developed as part of the Watt Institution by his son (which ultimately became the James Watt College). Taken over by the local authority in 1974, the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of Inverclyde, and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule. Watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in George Square, Glasgow and Princes Street, Edinburgh.

The James Watt College has expanded from its original location to include campuses in Kilwinning (North Ayrshire), Finnart Street and The Waterfront in Greenock, and the Sports campus in Largs. The Heriot-Watt University near Edinburgh was at one time the "Watt Institution and School of Arts" named in his memory, then merged with George Heriot's Hospital for needy orphans and the name was changed to Heriot-Watt College. Dozens of university and college buildings (chiefly of science and technology) are named after him.

The huge painting James Watt contemplating the steam engine by James Eckford Lauder is now owned by the National Gallery of Scotland.

Watt was ranked first, tying with Edison, among 229 significant figures in the history of technology by Charles Murray's survey of historiometry presented in his book Human Accomplishments. Watt was ranked 22nd in Michael H. Hart's list of the most influential figures in history.

The SI unit of power, the watt, is named after him, as are over 50 roads or streets in the UK.

A colossal statue of him by Chantrey was placed in Westminster Abbey, and on this cenotaph the inscription reads:

Blaise_Pascal



Blaise Pascal ( ), (June 19 1623   August 19 1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, and religious philosopher. He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father. Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the construction of mechanical calculators, the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalizing the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Pascal also wrote in defense of the scientific method.

He was a mathematician of the first order. Pascal helped create two major new areas of research. He wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of sixteen and corresponded with Pierre de Fermat from 1654 and later on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science.

Following a mystical experience in late 1654, he abandoned his scientific work and devoted himself to philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées. Pascal suffered from ill health throughout his life and died two months after his 39th birthday.




Born in Clermont-Ferrand, in the Auvergne region of France, Blaise Pascal lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three. His father, Étienne Pascal (1588–1651), was a local judge and member of the "noblesse de robe", who also had an interest in science and mathematics. Blaise Pascal was brother to Jacqueline Pascal the youngest sibling and Gilberte, the eldest.

In 1631, shortly after the death of his wife, Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. Étienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise.  The young Pascal showed an amazing  aptitude for mathematics and science. At the age of eleven, he composed a short treatise on the sounds of vibrating bodies and Étienne responded by forbidding his son to further pursue mathematics until the age of fifteen so as not to harm his study of Latin and Greek. One day, however, Étienne found Blaise (now twelve) writing an independent proof that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles with a piece of coal on a wall. From then on, the boy was allowed to study Euclid; perhaps more importantly, he was allowed to sit in as a silent on-looker at the gatherings of some of the greatest mathematicians and scientists in Europe—such as Roberval, Desargues, Mydorge, Gassendi, and Descartes—in the monastic cell of Père Mersenne. 
An early Pascaline on display at the Musée des Arts et Métiers in the Louvre Museum, Paris.

Particularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues's thinking, the sixteen-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the "Mystic Hexagram" (conic sections), Essai pour les coniques ("Essay on Conics").  And sent it - his first serious work of mathematics—to Père Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as  Pascal's theorem. 
Briefly, it can be explained thus:

* 2. Take a simple plane and slice the cone in two going across.
* 3. If the plane is straight across, the section cut out will be a circle.
* 4. If the plane is at an angle, the section cut out will be an ellipse. This is the more general case, because ellipses can be squat or long, thin or nearly round: Because Pascal wanted to prove a general theorem, he took the case of an ellipse.
* 5. Draw a six sided figure inside the ellipse. The figure does not have to be regular, and may intersect itself.
* 6. Now take a pencil and make big dots on the vertices of the hexagram, and draw lines between the vertices. Then, extend the lines out to where they cross.

Pascal's work was so precocious that Descartes, when shown the manuscript, refused to believe that the composition was not by the elder Pascal. 
When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: "I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients," adding, "but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a sixteen-year-old child." The Story of Civilization: Volume 8, "The Age of Louis XIV" by Will & Ariel Durant; chapter II, subsection 4.1 (pg. 56)

In France at that time offices and positions could be—and were—bought and sold. In 1631 Étienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65,665 livres. Connor, James A., Pascal's Wager(HarperCollins, NY,  2006)p.42  The money was invested in a government bond which provided if not a lavish then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Year War found it by defaulting on the government's bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.

Like so many others, Étienne's opposition to the fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu eventually forced him to flee Paris, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbor Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal, and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen — a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.

In 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid, Pascal, not yet nineteen,  constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal's calculator or the Pascaline.  The Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit one of his original mechanical calculators. Though these machines are early forerunners to computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Because it was extraordinarily expensive the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and status symbol, for the very rich both in France and throughout Europe; however Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade and built fifty machines in total.



Portrait of Blaise Pascal

In addition to the childhood marvels previously mentioned, Pascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life.  In 1653, Pascal wrote his Traité du triangle arithmétique ("Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle") in which he described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients, now called Pascal's triangle. In 1654, prompted by a friend interested in gambling problems, he corresponded with Fermat on the subject, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities. The friend was the Chevalier de Méré, and the specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point.  From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the Pensées) used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's Wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz's formulation of the infinitesimal calculus.   The Mathematical Leibniz

After a religious experience in 1654, Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics. However, after a sleepless night in 1658, he anonymously offered a prize for the quadrature of a cycloid.  Solutions were offered by Wallis, Huygens, Wren, and others; Pascal, under a pseudonym, published his own solution.  Controversy and heated argument followed after Pascal announced himself the winner.



Pascal's major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his De l'Esprit géométrique ("On the Geometrical Spirit"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous "Little Schools of Port-Royal" (Les Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal). The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.

Pascal also used De l'Esprit géométrique to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.

In De l'Art de persuader ("On the Art of Persuasion"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can only be grasped through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.



Pascal's work in the fields of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. By 1646, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli's experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment which involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a vacuum, some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, "Everything that is in motion must be moved by something," Aristotle declared. Aristotle,Physics,VII,1.  Ergo, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility. How so? As proof it was pointed out:
* Light passed through the so-called "vacuum" in the glass tube.
* Aristotle wrote how everything moved, and must be moved by something.
* Therefore, since there had to be an invisible "something" to move the light through the glass tube, there was no vacuum in the tube. Not in the glass tube or anywhere else. Vacuums—the absence of any and everything—were simply an impossibility.

Following more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide ("New Experiments with the Vacuum"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube.

On September 19, 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, Florin Périer, husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally to carry out the fact finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by Périer, reads:

"The weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o'clock that morning...the Puy-de-Dôme was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont has asked me to let them know when I made the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work...

"...at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured sixteen pounds of quicksilver...in to a vessel...then took several glass tubes..each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26" and 3½ lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time...

"I attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-Dôme, about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23" and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case..." Périer to Pascal, September 1647,Œuves completes de Pascal, 2:682.

Pascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, a height of about fifty meters. The mercury dropped two lines. These, and other lesser experiments carried out by Pascal, were hailed throughout Europe as establishing the principle and value of the barometer.

In the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal's empty space, Pascal, in his reply to Estienne Noel, gave one of the seventeenth century's major statements on the scientific method: "In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity." His insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with a number of other prominent scientists, including Descartes.







Pascal studying the cycloid, by Augustin Pajou, 1785, Louvre

Biographically, two basic influences led him to his conversion: sickness and Jansenism.  From as early as his eighteenth year, Pascal suffered from a nervous ailment that left him hardly a day without pain.  In 1647, a paralytic attack so disabled him that he could not move without crutches.  His head ached, his bowels burned, his legs and feet were continually cold, and required wearisome aids to circulate the blood; he wore stockings steeped in brandy to warm his feet.  Partly to get better medical treatment, he moved to Paris with his sister Jacqueline.  His health improved, but his nervous system had been permanently damaged.  Henceforth, he was subject to deepening hypochondria, which affected his character and his philosophy.  He became irritable, subject to fits of proud and imperious anger, and seldom smiled. Sainte-Beuve, Port-Royal, I, 89.

In the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58 year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be very serious, perhaps even fatal, condition. Fortunately at the time Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes, and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal "would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again..." Connor, James A. Pascal's Wager (HarperCollins, 2006)p.70  But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes were live-in guests at the Pascal household.

Both men were followers of Jean Guillebert, proponent of a splinter group of the main body of Catholic teaching known as Jansenius. This belief, which, though still fairly small, was making surprising headroads into French catholics, espoused a style of belief of rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctor frequently, and upon his successful treatment of Étienne, borrowed works by Jansenist authors through him.  In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of "first conversion" and began in the course of the following year to write on theological subjects.

Pascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what he called   a "worldly period" (1648–54).  His father died in 1651, and Pascal gained control over both his inheritance as well as his sister Jacqueline who announced that she intended to become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal by the first of the year. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because due to his life-long poor health he too needed her.

"Suddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either.At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind." Ibid. #4 p.122

By the end of October 1651 a truce had been reached between brother and sister: in return for a respectable annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over inheritance to her brother. (Their eldest sister Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a handsome dowry.) On 04 January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte, "He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor..." Jacqueline Pascal, "Memoir" p. 87 
On 05 June, 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering on the part of Jacqueline,
Pascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, by this time "had begun to smell like a cult." Ibid.#4 p.124  With two-thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29 year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty. Jacqueline vowed a life of poverty. Pascal teetered on the brink of living one.

But Time is the best physician. For an exciting while Pascal pursued the life of a foot-loose bachelor, even going so far as giving merry chase while in Auvergne to a lady of beauty and learning, whom he referred to as the "Sappho of the countryside." Pascal, Pensées, Havet ed. Introd., p. civ.   Around this time, Pascal wrote Discours sur les passions de l'amour ("Conversation about the Passions of Love"), and apparently he contemplated marriage   which he was later to describe as "the lowest of the conditions of life permitted to a Christian." Mesnard, Pascal, 57. 
Jacqueline reproached him for his frivolity and prayed for his reform.  During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God. Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 52.



On November 23 1654, Pascal is said to have been involved in an accident at the Neuilly-sur-Seine bridge where the horses plunged over the parapet and the carriage nearly followed them.  Fortunately, the reins broke and the coach hung halfway over the edge.  Pascal and his friends emerged unscathed, but the sensitive philosopher, terrified by the nearness of death, fainted away and remained unconscious for some time.  Upon recovering fifteen days later, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious vision and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began: "Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars…" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: "I will not forget thy word. Amen."  He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. Oeuvres complètes, 618.  This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of the carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars  MathPages, .

His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris.  It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters.




Beginning in 1656, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry, a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period (especially the Jesuits, and in particular Antonio Escobar). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. His method of framing his arguments was clever: the Provincial Letters pretended to be the report of a Parisian to a friend in the provinces on the moral and theological issues then exciting the intellectual and religious circles in the capital. Pascal, combining the fervor of a convert with the wit and polish of a man of the world, reached a new level of style in French prose.  The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the formulary controversy, the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical.  The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied the Pope himself, provoking Alexander VII to condemn the letters.  But that didn't stop all of educated France from reading them.  Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments.  He condemned "laxism" in the church and ordered a revision of casuistical texts just a few years later (1665–66).

Aside from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.



When Pascal was back in Paris just after overseeing the publication of the last Letter, his religion was reinforced by the close association to an apparent miracle in the chapel of the Port-Royal nunnery.  His 10-year-old niece, Marguerite Périer, was suffering from a painful fistula lacrymalis that exuded noisome pus through her eyes and nose—an affliction the doctors pronounced hopeless.  Then, on March 24, 1657, a believer presented to Port-Royal what he and others claimed to be a thorn from the crown that had tortured Christ.  The nuns, in solemn ceremony and singing psalms, placed the thorn on their altar.  Each in turn kissed the relic, and one of them, seeing Marguerite among the worshipers, took the thorn and with it touched the girl's sore.  That evening, we are told, Marguerite expressed surprise that her eye no longer pained her; her mother was astonished to find no sign of the fistula; a physician, summoned, reported that the discharge and swelling had disappeared.  He, not the nuns, spread word of what he termed a miraculous cure.  Seven other physicians who had had previous knowledge of Marguerite's fistula signed a statement that in their judgment a miracle had taken place.  The diocesan officials investigated, came to the same conclusion, and authorized a Te Deum Mass in Port-Royal.  Crowds of believers came to see and kiss the thorn; all of Catholic Paris acclaimed a miracle.  Later, both Jansenists and Catholics used this well-documented miracle to their defense.  In 1728, Pope Benedict XIII referred to the case as proving that the age of miracles had not passed.

Pascal made himself an armorial emblem of an eye surrounded by a crown of thorns, with the inscription Scio cui credidi—"I know whom I have believed." Sainte-Beuve, Port-Royal, III, 173f.; Beard, Charles, Port-Royal, I 84.   His beliefs renewed, he set his mind to write his final, unfinished testament, the Pensées.




Unfortunately, Pascal could not finish his most influential theological work, referred posthumously as the Pensées ("Thoughts"), before his death.  It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination of and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion Chrétienne ("Defense of the Christian Religion").  What was found upon sifting through his personal items after his death were numerous scraps of paper with isolated thoughts, grouped in a tentative, but telling, order.  The first version of the detached notes appeared in print as a book in 1670 titled Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets ("Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on other subjects") and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the Apology's main strategy was to use the contradictory philosophies of skepticism and stoicism, personnalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God. This strategy was deemed quite hazardous by Pierre Nicole, Antoine Arnauld and other friends and scholars of Port-Royal, who were concerned that these fragmentary "thoughts" might lead to skepticism rather than to piety. Henceforth, they concealed the skeptical pieces and modified some of the rest, lest King or Church should take offense Pascal, Pensées, Introduction, p. xxviii; Mesnard, Pascal, 137–138.  for at that time the persecution of Port-Royal had ceased, and the editors were not interested in a renewal of controversy.  Not until the nineteenth century were the Pensées published in their full and authentic text.

Pascal's Pensées is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose.  When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language. Sainte-Beuve, Seventeenth Century, 174.   Will Durant, in his 11-volume, comprehensive The Story of Civilization series, hailed it as "the most eloquent book in French prose." The Story of Civilization: Volume 8, "The Age of Louis XIV" by Will & Ariel Durant, chapter II, Subsection 4.4 (pg. 66)   In Pensées, Pascal surveys several philosophical paradoxes: infinity and nothing, faith and reason, soul and matter, death and life, meaning and vanity—seemingly arriving at no definitive conclusions besides humility, ignorance, and grace.  Rolling these into one he develops Pascal's Wager.



Pascal's epitaph in Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, where he was buried

T. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as "a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world." Pascal's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for man to suffer. In 1659, Pascal, whose health had never been good, fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, "Sickness is the natural state of Christians." Muir, 104.

Louis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, Écrit sur la signature du formulaire ("Writ on the Signing of the Form"), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism. Pascal's last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line, moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats.

In 1662, Pascal's illness became more violent. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on August 18, 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction. He died the next morning, his last words being "May God never abandon me," and was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont. Muir, 104.

An autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with damage to his brain. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his continual poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on tuberculosis, stomach cancer, or a combination of the two. Muir, 103.  The headaches which afflicted Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion.



In honor of his scientific contributions, the name Pascal has been given to the SI unit of pressure, to a programming language, and Pascal's law (an important principle of hydrostatics), and as mentioned above, Pascal's triangle and Pascal's wager still bear his name.

Pascal's development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in actuarial science. John Ross writes, "Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future events."  However, it should be noted that Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace.

In literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists. The content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the rationalism of René Descartes and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy, empiricism, was also insufficient for determining major truths.



In France, a prestigious annual competition is held for outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region named after Pascal (the Blaise Pascal Chair).

In Canada, there is an annual math contest named in his honour. The Pascal Contest is open to any student in Canada who is fourteen years or under and is in grade nine or lower.

A discussion of Pascal figures prominently in the movie My Night At Maud's by the French director Éric Rohmer.

Roberto Rossellini directed a filmed biopic (entitled Blaise Pascal) which originally aired on Italian television in 1971. Pierre Arditi starred as Pascal.

Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb



Charles Augustin de Coulomb (born June 14, 1736, Angoulême, France - died August 23, 1806, Paris, France) was a French physicist. He is best known for developing Coulomb's law: the definition of the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion. The SI unit of charge, the coulomb, was named after him.



Coulomb was born in Angoulême, France, to a well to do family. His father, Henri Coulomb, was inspector of the Royal Fields in Montpellier. His mother, Catherine Bajet, came from a wealthy family in the wool trade. When Coulomb was a boy the family moved to Paris, and there Coulomb studied at the prestigious Collège des Quatre-Nations. The courses of mathematics there under Pierre Charles Monnier made him decide to pursue mathematics and the similar subjects as a career. From 1757 to 1759 he joined his father's family in Montpellier and took part in the work of the academy of the city, directed by the mathematician Augustin Danyzy. With his father's approval, Coulomb returned to Paris in 1759  to  successfully study for the entrance examination at the military school at Mézières.

At his exit from the school in 1761, he initially took part in the survey for the British coastal charts, then was sent on mission to Martinique in 1764  to take part in the construction of the Fort Bourbon under the orders of the lieutenant-colonel of Rochemore, as the French colony was insulated in the middle of the English and Spanish possessions following the Seven Years' War. Coulomb spent eight years directing the work, contracting tropical fever. He carried out several experiments on the resistance of masonries and the behaviour of the walls of escarpe (supportings), which were inspired by the ideas of Pieter van Musschenbroek on friction.

Upon his return, with the rank of Captain, he was employed at La Rochelle, the Isle of Aix and Cherbourg. He discovered an inverse relationship of the force between electric charges and the square of its distance, later named after him as Coulomb's law.

In 1781, he was stationed permanently at Paris. On the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he resigned his appointment as intendant des eaux et fontaines, and retired to a small estate which he possessed at Blois. He was recalled to Paris for a time in order to take part in the new determination of weights and measures, which had been decreed by the Revolutionary government. He was one of the first members of the National Institute; he was appointed inspector of public instruction in 1802 . But his health was already very feeble, and four years later he died in Paris, France.

Coulomb leaves a legacy as a hero in the field of geotechnical engineering for his contribution to retaining wall design.



Coulomb is distinguished in the history of mechanics and of electricity and magnetism. In 1779  he published an important investigation of the laws of friction, Théorie des machines simples, en ayant égard au frottement de leurs parties et à la roideur des cordages (Theory of simple machines with regard for the friction of their parts and the tension of the ropes), which was followed twenty years later by a memoir on viscosity.

In 1784  his Recherches théoriques et expérimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l'élasticité des fils de metal  Histoire de l’Académie Royale des Sciences, 229-269, 1784  (Theoretical research and experimentation on torsion and the elasticity of metal wire) appeared. This memoir contained a description of different forms of his torsion balance. He used the instrument with great success for the experimental investigation of the distribution of charge on surfaces, of the laws of electrical and magnetic force, and of the mathematical theory of which he may also be regarded as the founder.

Coulomb's torsion balance
In 1785  Coulomb presented his three reports on Electricity and Magnetism:

- Premier Mémoire sur l’Electricité et le Magnétisme  Histoire de l’Académie Royale des Sciences, 569-577, 1785 . In this publication Coulomb describes “How to construct and use an electric balance (torsion balance) based on the property of the metal wires of having a reaction torsion force proportional to the torsion angle”.  Coulomb also experimentally determined the law that explains how “two bodies electrified of the same kind of Electricity exert on each other”.

- Sécond Mémoire sur l’Electricité et le Magnétisme  Histoire de l’Académie Royale des Sciences, 578-611, 1785 . In this publication Coulomb carries out the “determination according to which laws both the Magnetic and the Electric fluids act, either by repulsion or by attraction”.

- Troisième Mémoire sur l’Electricité et le Magnétisme  Histoire de l’Académie Royale des Sciences, 612-638, 1785 . “On the quantity of Electricity that an isolated body loses in a certain time period , either by contact with less humid air, or in the supports more or less idio-electric”.

Four subsequent reports were published in the following years:

- Quatrième Mémoire  "Where two principal properties of the electric fluid are demonstrated: first, that this fluid does not expand into any object according to a chemical affinity, or by an elective attraction, but that it divides itself between different objects brought into contact; second, that in conducting objects, the fluid, having achieved a state of stability, expands on the surface of the body and does not penetrate into the interior." (1786)

- Cinquième Mémoire  "On the manner in which the electric fluid divides itself between conducting objects brought into contact, and the distribution of this fluid on the different parts of the surface of this object." (1787)

- Sixième Mémoire "Continuation of research into the distribution of the electric fluid between several conductors. Determination of electric density at different points on the surface of these bodies." (1788)

- Septième Mémoire. "On magnetism" (1789)

Coulomb explained the laws of attraction and repulsion between electric charges and magnetic poles, although he did not find any relationship between the two phenomena.  He thought that the attraction and repulsion were due to different kinds of fluids.

Piano



Baby Grand Piano
The piano is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard that produces sound by striking steel strings with felt covered hammers. The hammers immediately rebound, allowing the strings to continue vibrating at their resonant frequency. " Hammer Time" by John Kiehl, Wolfram Demonstrations Project.  These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that couples the acoustic energy to the air so that it can be heard as sound.

The piano is widely used in Western music for solo performance, ensemble use, chamber music, and accompaniment. It is also very popular as an aid to composing and rehearsal. Although not portable and often expensive, the piano's versatility and ubiquity  have made it one of the most familiar musical instruments. It is sometimes classified as both a percussion and a stringed instrument. According to the Hornbostel-Sachs method of music classification, it is grouped with Chordophones.

The word piano is a shortened form of the word pianoforte, which is seldom used except in formal language and derived from the original Italian name for the instrument, clavicembalo [or gravicembalo] col piano e forte (literally harpsichord with soft and loud). This refers to the instrument's responsiveness to keyboard touch, which allows the pianist to produce notes at different dynamic levels by controlling the speed with which the hammers hit the strings.




Early piano replica by the modern builder Paul McNulty, after Walter & Sohn, 1805

The piano was originally founded on earlier technological innovations. The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers originating from the Persian traditional musical instrument santur. David R. Peterson (1994), "Acoustics of the hammered dulcimer, its history, and recent developments", Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 95 (5), p. 3002.  During the Middle Ages, there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings, Pollens, 1995. chp. 1  the earliest being the hurdy gurdy which has uncertain origins.    By the 17th century, the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well known. In a clavichord the strings are struck by tangents, while in a harpsichord they are plucked by quills. Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case, soundboard, bridge, and keyboard.

Grand piano by Louis Bas of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, France, 1781. Earliest French grand piano known to survive; includes an inverted wrestplank and action derived from the work of Bartolomeo Cristofiori (ca. 1700) with ornately decorated soundboard.
The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori of Padua, Italy, who was employed by Prince Ferdinand de Medici as the Keeper of the Instruments. He was an expert harpsichord maker and was well acquainted with the previous body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments. It is not known exactly when Cristofori first built a piano.  An inventory made by his employers, the Medici family, indicates the existence of a piano by the year 1700; another document of doubtful authenticity indicates a date of 1698.  The three Cristofori pianos that survive today date from the 1720s.

Cristofori's great success was in solving, without any prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammer must strike the string, but not remain in contact with it (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would damp the sound. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently, and it must be possible to repeat a note rapidly. Cristofori's piano action served as a model for the many different approaches to piano actions that followed. While Cristofori's early instruments were made with thin strings and were much quieter than the modern piano, compared to the clavichord (the only previous keyboard instrument capable of minutely controlled dynamic nuance through the keyboard) they were considerably louder and had more sustaining power.

Cristofori's new instrument remained relatively unknown until an Italian writer, Scipione Maffei, wrote an enthusiastic article about it (1711), including a diagram of the mechanism. This article was widely distributed, and most of the next generation of piano builders started their work because of reading it. One of these builders was Gottfried Silbermann, better known as an organ builder. Silbermann's pianos were virtually direct copies of Cristofori's, with one important addition: Silbermann invented the forerunner of the modern damper pedal, which lifts all the dampers from the strings at once.

Silbermann showed Johann Sebastian Bach one of his early instruments in the 1730s, but Bach did not like it at that time, claiming that the higher notes were too soft to allow a full dynamic range. Although this earned him some animosity from Silbermann, the criticism was apparently heeded. Bach did approve of a later instrument he saw in 1747, and even served as an agent in selling Silbermann's pianos.

Piano making flourished during the late 18th century in the Viennese school, which included Johann Andreas Stein (who worked in Augsburg, Germany) and the Viennese makers Nannette Streicher (daughter of Johann Andreas Stein) and Anton Walter. Viennese-style pianos were built with wood frames, two strings per note, and had leather-covered hammers. Some of these Viennese pianos had the opposite coloring of modern-day pianos; the natural keys were black and the accidental keys white.     It was for such instruments that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed his concertos and sonatas, and replicas of them are built today for use in authentic-instrument performance of his music. The pianos of Mozart's day had a softer, clearer tone than today's pianos or English pianos, with less sustaining power. The term fortepiano is nowadays often used to distinguish the 18th-century instrument from later pianos.




In the period lasting from about 1790 to 1860, the Mozart-era piano underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a consistent preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, and made possible by the ongoing Industrial Revolution with technological resources such as high-quality steel, called piano wire, for strings, and precision casting for the production of iron frames. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five octaves of Mozart's day to the 7⅓ or more octaves found on modern pianos.
Broadwood square action
Early technological progress owed much to the English firm of Broadwood, who already had a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of its harpsichords. Broadwood constructed instruments that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed. They sent pianos to both Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a fifth during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The Viennese makers similarly followed these trends, however the two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods were more robust, Viennese instruments were more sensitive.

Erard square action
By the 1820s, the center of innovation had shifted to Paris, where the Pleyel firm manufactured pianos used by Frédéric Chopin and the Érard firm manufactured those used by Franz Liszt. In 1821, Sébastien Érard invented the double escapement action, which permitted a note to be repeated even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes - and this musical device was pioneered by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by Henri Herz, the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos, and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced.

One of the major technical innovations that helped to create the sound of the modern piano was the use of a strong iron frame. Also called the "plate", the iron frame sits atop the soundboard, and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension. The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings.  In a modern grand the total string tension can exceed 20 tons. The single piece cast iron frame was patented in 1825 in Boston by Alpheus Babcock, combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). Babcock later worked for the Chickering & Mackays firm who patented the first full iron frame for grand pianos in 1843. Composite forged metal frames were preferred by many European makers until the American system was fully adopted by the early 20th century.

Other innovations for the mechanism included the use of felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather hammers. Felt hammers, which were first introduced by Henri Pape in 1826, were a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The sostenuto pedal (see below), invented in 1844 by Jean Louis Boisselot and improved by the Steinway firm in 1874, allowed a wider range of effects.

Other important technical innovations of this era included changes to the way the piano was strung, such as the use of a "choir" of three strings rather than two for all but the lower notes, and the use of different stringing methods. With the over strung scale, also called "cross-stringing", the strings are placed in a vertically overlapping slanted arrangement, with two heights of bridges on the soundboard instead of just one. This permits larger, but not necessarily longer, strings to fit within the case of the piano. Over stringing was invented by Jean-Henri Pape during the 1820s, and first patented for use in grand pianos in the United States by Henry Steinway Jr. in 1859.
Duplex scaling: Treble strings of a 182 cm. grand piano. From lower left to upper right: dampers, main sounding length of strings, treble bridge, duplex string length, duplex bridge (long bar perpendicular to strings), hitchpins. With duplexes or aliquot scales, which was patented in 1872 by Theodore Steinway, the different components of string vibrations are controlled by tuning their secondary parts in octave relationships with the sounding lengths. Similar systems developed by Blüthner (1872), as well as  Taskin (1788), and Collard (1821) used more distinctly ringing undamped vibrations to modify tone.

Some early pianos had shapes and designs that are no longer in use. The square piano had horizontal strings arranged diagonally across the rectangular case above the hammers and with the keyboard set in the long side. This design is attributed to Gottfried Silbermann or Christian Ernst Friderici on the continent, and Johannes Zumpe or Harman Vietor in England and it was improved by changes first introduced by Guillaume-Lebrecht Petzold in France and Alpheus Babcock in the United States. Square pianos were built in great numbers through the 1840s in Europe and the 1890s in America, and saw the most visible changes of any type of piano: the celebrated iron framed over strung squares manufactured by Steinway & Sons were more than two and a half times the size of Zumpe's wood framed instruments from a century before. Their overwhelming popularity was due to inexpensive construction and price, although their performance and tone were often limited by simple actions and closely spaced strings.

The mechanism in upright pianos is perpendicular to the keys.
The tall, vertically strung upright grand was arranged like a grand set on end, with the soundboard and bridges above the keys, and tuning pins below them. The term was later revived by many manufacturers for advertising purposes. Giraffe, pyramid and lyre pianos were arranged in a somewhat similar fashion in evocatively shaped cases.

The very tall cabinet piano was introduced about 1805 and was built through the 1840s. It had strings arranged vertically on a continuous frame with bridges extended nearly to the floor, behind the keyboard and very large sticker action. The short cottage upright or pianino with vertical stringing, made popular by Robert Wornum around 1815, was built into the 20th century. They are informally called birdcage pianos because of their prominent damper mechanism. Pianinos were distinguished from the oblique, or diagonally strung upright made popular in France by Roller & Blanchet during the late 1820s. The tiny spinet upright was manufactured from the mid-1930s until recent times. The low position of the hammers required the use of a "drop action" to preserve a reasonable keyboard height.

Modern upright and grand pianos attained their present forms by the end of the 19th century. Improvements have been made in manufacturing processes, and many individual details of the instrument continue to receive attention.




Much of the most widely admired piano repertoire, for example, that of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, was composed for a type of instrument that is rather different from the modern instruments on which this music is normally performed today. Even the music of the Romantics, including Liszt, Chopin, Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelssohn and Johannes Brahms, was written for pianos substantially different from ours.



A schematic depiction of the construction of a pianoforte.


Modern pianos come in two basic configurations (with subcategories): the grand piano and the upright piano.


Grand piano
In grand pianos, the frame and strings are horizontal, with the strings extending away from the keyboard. There are several sizes of grand piano. A rough generalization distinguishes the "concert grand" (between about   and   long) from the "parlor grand" or "boudoir grand" (about   to  ) and the smaller "baby grand".

All else being equal, longer pianos with longer strings have better sound and lower inharmonicity of the strings. Inharmonicity is the degree to which the frequencies of overtones (known as partials, partial tones, or harmonics) depart from whole multiples of the fundamental frequency. Pianos with shorter, thicker, and stiffer strings (e.g., baby grands) have more inharmonicity. The longer strings on a concert grand can vibrate more freely than the shorter, thicker strings on a baby grand, which means that a concert grand's strings will have truer overtones. This is partly because the strings will be tuned closer to equal temperament in relation to the standard pitch with less "stretching" in the piano tuning (See: Piano tuning). Full-size grands are usually used for public concerts, whereas smaller grands, introduced by Sohmer & Co. in 1884, are often chosen for domestic use where space and cost are considerations.



Upright piano

Upright pianos, also called vertical pianos, are more compact because the frame and strings are  vertical. It is considered harder to produce a sensitive piano action when the hammers move horizontally, as the vertical hammer return is dependent on springs which are prone to wear and tear. However, a well-regulated vertical piano will probably play more smoothly than a poorly regulated grand piano, and the very best upright pianos approach the level of some grand pianos of the same size in tone quality and responsiveness.

One noticeable advantage that the grand piano action has over the vertical action is that all grand pianos have a special repetition lever in the playing action that is absent in all verticals. This repetition lever, a separate one for every key, catches the hammer close to the strings as long as the keys are played repeatedly and fairly quickly. In this position, with the hammer resting on the lever, a pianist can play repeated notes, staccato, and trills with much more speed and control than is possible on a vertical piano.

Upright pianos with unusually tall frames and long strings are sometimes called "upright grand" pianos.

Some authors classify modern pianos according to their height and, to modifications of the action that are necessary to accomodate the height.
* Studio pianos are around 42 to 45 inches tall.  This is the shortest cabinet that can accomodate a 'full-sized' action located above the keyboard.
* Console pianos have a compact action (shorter hammers), and are a few inches shorter than studio models.
* The top of a Spinet model barely rises above the keyboard.  The action is located below, operated by vertical wires that are attached to the backs of the keys.
* Anything taller than a studio piano is called an upright.



Player piano
Toy pianos began to be manufactured in the 19th century. In 1863, Henri Fourneaux invented the player piano, which "plays itself" from a piano roll without the need for a pianist. The player piano is a piano that records a performance using rolls of paper with perforations, and then replays the performance using pneumatic devices. A modern equivalent for the player piano is the Yamaha Disklavier system, which uses solenoids and midi instead of pneumatics and rolls. Silent pianos, which allow a regular piano to be used converted to a digital instrument, are a recent innovation and are becoming more popular.

Irving Berlin played a special piano called the transposing piano, which was invented in 1801 by Edward Ryley. It had a lever under the keyboard used to alter the music to any key. One of Berlin's pianos is in the Smithsonian Museum. For much of his career, Berlin only knew how to play the black keys. But with his 'trick piano' he was no longer limited to the key of F-sharp.

A relatively recent development is the prepared piano, which is used in contemporary art music. A prepared piano is a standard grand piano which has had objects placed inside it before a performance in order to alter its sound, or which has had its mechanism changed in some way. The scores for music for prepared piano often instruct the pianist to insert pieces of rubber or small pieces of metal (screws or washers) in between the strings. These added items either mute the strings or create unusual vibrating sounds.

Since the 1980s, digital pianos have been available, which use digital sampling technology to reproduce the sound of each piano note. The best digital pianos are sophisticated, with features including working pedals, weighted keys, multiple voices, and MIDI interfaces. However, with such technology, it is difficult to duplicate one particular aspect of acoustic pianos, namely that when the damper pedal (see below) is depressed, the strings not struck vibrate sympathetically when other strings are struck, as well as the unique instrument-specific mathematical non-linearity of partials on any given unison. Since this sympathetic vibration is considered central to piano tone,  many digital pianos do not sound the same as the best acoustic pianos. Progress is being made in this area by including physical models of sympathetic vibration in the synthesis software.  Some higher end digital pianos, such as the Yamaha Clavinova series, or the KAWAI MP8 series, produced in the last few years incorporate string resonance technology to overcome this limitation.

With the advent of powerful desktop computers, highly realistic sampled digital grand pianos have become available as affordable software modules.  Some use multi-gigabyte piano sample sets with as many as 90 recordings, each lasting many seconds, for each of the 88 keys under different conditions, augmented by additional samples to emulate sympathetic resonance, key release, the drop of the dampers, and simulations of piano techniques like re-pedaling.




Keyboard
Almost every modern piano has 36 black keys and 52 white keys for a total of 88 keys (seven octaves plus a minor third, from A0 to C8). Many older pianos only have 85 keys (seven octaves from A0 to A7), while some manufacturers extend the range further in one or both directions.

Some Bösendorfer pianos extend the normal range downwards to F0, with one other model going as far as a bottom C0, making a full eight octave range. These extra keys are sometimes hidden under a small hinged lid that can be flipped down to cover the keys in order to avoid visual disorientation in a pianist unfamiliar with the extended keyboard. On others, the colours of the extra white keys are reversed (black instead of white).

The extra keys are added primarily for increased resonance from the associated strings; that is, they vibrate sympathetically with other strings whenever the damper pedal is depressed and thus give a fuller tone. Only a very small number of works composed for piano actually use these notes. More recently, the Stuart and Sons company has also manufactured extended-range pianos. On their instruments, the range is extended both down the bass to F0 and up the treble to F8 for a full eight octaves. The extra keys are the same as the other keys in appearance.

Small studio upright acoustical pianos with only 65 keys have been manufactured for use by roving pianists. Known as "gig" pianos and still containing a cast iron harp, these are comparatively lightweight and can be easily transported to and from engagements by only two men. As their harp is longer than that of a spinet or console piano, they have a stronger bass sound that to some pianists is well worth the trade-off in range that a reduced key-set offers.



Piano pedals from left to right: una corda, sostenuto, and damper.

Pianos have had pedals, or some close equivalent, since the earliest days. (In the 18th century, some pianos used levers pressed upward by the player's knee instead of pedals.) Most grand pianos have three pedals: soft pedal (una corda), sostenuto, and sustain pedal (from left to right, respectively). Most modern upright pianos have three pedals: soft pedal, practice pedal and sustain pedal, though older or cheaper models may lack the practice pedal.

The sustain pedal (or, damper pedal) is often simply called "the pedal", since it is the most frequently used. It is placed as the rightmost pedal in the group. It lifts the dampers from all keys, sustaining all played notes, and altering the overall tone.

The soft pedal or una corda pedal is placed leftmost in the row of pedals. In grand pianos, it shifts the entire action, including the keyboard, to the right, so that the hammers hit only one of the three strings for each note (hence the name una corda, or 'one string'). The effect is to soften the note as well as to change the tone. In uprights, this action is not possible, and so the pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings, allowing the hammers to hit the strings with less kinetic energy to produce a softer sound.

On grand pianos, the middle pedal is a sostenuto pedal. This pedal keeps raised any damper that was already raised at the moment the pedal is depressed. This makes it possible to sustain some notes (by depressing the sostenuto pedal before notes to be sustained are released) while the player's hands are free to play other notes. This can be useful for musical passages with pedal points and other otherwise tricky or impossible situations.

On many upright pianos, there is a middle pedal called the 'practice' or celeste pedal. This drops a piece of felt between the hammers and strings, greatly muting the sounds.

There are also non-standard variants. On vertical pianos, the middle pedal can be a bass sustain pedal: that is, when it is depressed, the dampers lift off the strings only in the bass section. This pedal would be used only when a pianist needs to sustain a single bass note or chord over many measures, while playing the melody in the treble section. On the largest Fazioli piano, there is a fourth pedal to the left of the principal three. This fourth pedal works in the same way as the soft pedal of an upright piano, moving the hammers closer to the strings.



An upright pedal piano
The rare transposing piano, of which Irving Berlin possessed an example, had a middle pedal that functioned as a clutch which disengages the keyboard from the mechanism, enabling the keyboard to be moved to the left or right with a lever. The entire action of the piano is thus shifted to allow the pianist to play music written in one key so that it sounds in a different key. The pedalier piano, or pedal piano, is a rare type of piano that includes a pedalboard, enabling bass register notes to be played with the feet, as is standard on the organ. There are two types of pedal piano: the pedal board may be an integral part of the instrument, using the same strings and mechanism as the manual keyboard, or, less frequently, it may consist of two independent pianos (each with its separate mechanics and strings) which are placed one above the other, a regular piano played by the hands and a bass-register piano played by the feet.



Many parts of a piano are made of materials selected for sturdiness. In quality pianos, the outer rim of the piano is made of a hardwood, normally maple or beech. According to  Harold A. Conklin, the purpose of a sturdy rim is so that "the vibrational energy will stay as much as possible in the soundboard instead of dissipating uselessly in the case parts, which are inefficient radiators of sound."

View from below of a 182-cm grand piano. In order of distance from viewer: softwood braces, tapered soundboard ribs, soundboard. The metal rod at lower right is a humidity control device.
The rim is normally made by laminating flexible strips of hardwood to the desired shape, a system that was developed by Theodore Steinway in 1880. The thick wooden braces at the bottom (grands) or back (uprights) of the piano are not as acoustically important as the rim, and are often made of a softwood, even in top-quality pianos, in order to save weight. The requirement of structural strength, fulfilled with stout hardwood and thick metal, makes a piano heavy; even a small upright can weigh 136 kg (300 lb), and the Steinway concert grand (Model D) weighs 480 kg (990 lb). The largest piano built, the Fazioli F308, weighs 691 kg (1520 lb).

The pinblock, which holds the tuning pins in place, is another area of the piano where toughness is important. It is made of hardwood, (often maple) and generally is laminated (built of multiple layers) for additional strength and gripping power. Piano strings (also called piano wire), which must endure years of extreme tension and hard blows, are made of high quality steel. They are manufactured to vary as little as possible in diameter, since all deviations from uniformity introduce tonal distortion. The bass strings of a piano are made of a steel core wrapped with copper wire, to increase their mass whilst retaining flexibility.

The plate, or metal frame, of a piano is usually made of cast iron. It is advantageous for the plate to be quite massive. Since the strings are attached to the plate at one end, any vibrations transmitted to the plate will result in loss of energy to the desired (efficient) channel of sound transmission, namely the bridge and the soundboard. Some manufacturers now use cast steel in their plates, for greater strength. The casting of the plate is a delicate art, since the dimensions are crucial and the iron shrinks by about one percent during cooling.

The inclusion in a piano of an extremely large piece of metal is potentially an aesthetic handicap, which piano makers overcome by polishing, painting and decorating the plate. Plates often include the manufacturer's ornamental medallion and can be strikingly attractive. In an effort to make pianos lighter, Alcoa worked with Winter and Company piano manufacturers to make pianos using an aluminum plate during the 1940s. The use of aluminum for piano plates, however, did not become widely accepted and was discontinued.

The numerous grand parts and upright parts of a piano action are generally hardwood (e.g. maple, beech. hornbeam). However, since World War II, plastics have become available. Early plastics were incorporated into some pianos in the late 1940s and 1950s, but proved disastrous because they crystallized and lost their strength after only a few decades of use. The Steinway firm once incorporated Teflon, a synthetic material developed by DuPont, for some grand action parts in place of cloth, but ultimately abandoned the experiment due to an inherent "clicking" which invariably developed over time. (Also Teflon is "humidity stable" whereas the wood adjacent to the Teflon will swell and shrink with humidity changes, causing problems.) More recently, the Kawai firm has built pianos with action parts made of more modern and effective plastics such as carbon fiber; these parts have held up better and have generally received the respect of piano technicians .

The part of the piano where materials probably matter more than anywhere else is the soundboard. In quality pianos, this is made of solid spruce (that is, spruce boards glued together at their edges). Spruce is chosen for its high ratio of strength to weight. The best piano makers use close-grained, quarter-sawn, defect-free spruce, and make sure that it has been carefully dried over a long period of time before making it into soundboards. In cheap pianos, the soundboard is often made of plywood.

Piano keys are generally made of spruce or basswood, for lightness. Spruce is normally used in high-quality pianos. Traditionally, the black keys were made from ebony and the white keys were covered with strips of ivory, but since ivory-yielding species are now endangered and protected by treaty, plastics are now almost exclusively used. Also, ivory tends to chip more easily than plastic. Legal ivory can still be obtained in limited quantities. At one time, the Yamaha firm innovated a plastic called "Ivorine" or "Ivorite", since imitated by other makers, that mimics the look and feel of ivory.




A piano tuner
Pianos need regular tuning to keep them up to pitch, which is usually the internationally recognized standard concert pitch of A4 = 440 Hz. The hammers of pianos are voiced to compensate for gradual hardening, and other parts also need periodic regulation. Aged and worn pianos can be rebuilt or reconditioned. Often, by replacing a great number of their parts, they can be made to perform as well as new pianos. Older pianos are often more settled and produce a warmer tone.

Piano moving should be done by trained piano movers using adequate manpower and the correct equipment for any particular piano's size and weight.  Pianos are heavy yet delicate instruments. Over the years, professional piano movers have developed special techniques for transporting both grands and uprights which prevent damage to the case and to the piano's mechanics.




The piano at the social center in the 19th century (Moritz von Schwind, 1868). The man at the piano is Franz Schubert.
The piano is a crucial instrument in Western classical music, jazz, film, television, and most other complex western musical genres. Since a large number of composers are proficient pianists – and because the piano keyboard offers an easy means of complex melodic and harmonic interplay – the piano is often used as a tool for composition.

Pianos were, and still are, popular instruments for private household ownership.  Hence, pianos have gained a place in the popular consciousness, and are sometimes referred to by nicknames including: "the ivories", "the joanna", "the eighty-eight", and "the black(s) and white(s)", "the little joe(s)". Playing the piano is sometimes referred to as "tickling the ivories".

Violin



The violin is a bowed string instrument with four strings usually tuned in perfect fifths. It is the smallest and highest-pitched member of the violin family of string instruments, which also includes the viola and cello.

A violin is sometimes informally called a fiddle, regardless of the type of music played on it. The word "violin" comes from the Middle Latin word vitula, meaning "stringed instrument";    this word is also believed to be the source of the Germanic "fiddle".     The violin, while it has ancient origins, acquired most of its modern characteristics in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th century.  Violinists and collectors particularly prize the instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Cremona.

A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier, or simply a violin maker. The parts of a violin are usually made from different types of wood (although electric violins may not be made of wood at all, since their sound may not be dependent on specific acoustic characteristics of the instrument's construction), and it is generally strung with gut or steel strings.

Someone who plays the violin is called a violinist or a fiddler. He or she produces sound from a violin by either drawing a bow (normally held in the right hand) across one or more strings (which may be stopped by the fingers of the other hand to produce a full range of pitches), plucking the strings (with either hand), or a variety of other techniques.  The violin is played by musicians in a wide variety of musical genres, including classical, jazz, folk and traditional, and rock and roll.




The earliest stringed instruments were mostly plucked (e.g. the Greek lyre). Bowed instruments may have originated in the equestrian cultures of Central Asia, an example being the Mongolian instrument Morin huur:
:Turkic and Mongolian horsemen from Inner Asia were probably the world’s earliest fiddlers. Their two-stringed upright fiddles were strung with horsehair strings, played with horsehair bows, and often feature a carved horse’s head at the end of the neck. ... The violins, violas, and cellos we play today, and whose bows are still strung with horsehair, are a legacy of the nomads.

It is believed that these instruments eventually spread to China, India, and the Middle East, where they developed into instruments such as the erhu in China, the rebab in the Middle East, and the esraj in India. The violin in its present form emerged in early 16th century in Northern Italy, where the port towns of Venice and Genoa maintained extensive ties to central Asia through the trade routes of the silk road.

The modern European violin evolved from various bowed stringed instruments which were brought from the Middle East.    Most likely the first makers of violins borrowed from three types of current instruments: the rebec, in use since the 10th century (itself derived from the Arabic rebab), the Renaissance fiddle, and the lira da braccio.   
One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning, was in the Epitome musical by Jambe de Fer, published in Lyon in 1556.    By this time, the violin had already begun to spread throughout Europe.

The oldest documented violin to have four strings, like the modern violin, is supposed to have been constructed in 1555 by Andrea Amati, but the date is doubtuful. (Other violins, documented significantly earlier, only had three strings.)  The violin immediately became very popular, both among street musicians and the nobility, illustrated by the fact that the French king Charles IX ordered Amati to construct 24 violins for him in 1560.    The oldest surviving violin, dated inside, is from this set, and is known as the "Charles IX," made in Cremona c. 1560. "The Messiah" or "Le Messie" (also known as the "Salabue") made by Antonio Stradivari in 1716 remains pristine, never having been used. It is now located in the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford.

San Zaccaria Altarpiece (detail), Venice, Giovanni Bellini, 1505
The most famous violin makers (luthiers) between the 16th century and the 18th century include:

* The school of Brescia, beginning in the 16th century
* The Amati family of Italian violin makers, active 1500-1740 in Cremona, Italy
* The Guarneri family, active 1626-1744 in Cremona
* The Stradivari family, active 1644-1737 in Cremona

Significant changes occurred in the construction of the violin in the 18th century, particularly in the length and angle of the neck, as well as a heavier bass bar. The majority of old instruments have undergone these modifications, and hence are in a significantly different state than when they left the hands of their makers, doubtless with differences in sound and response.       But these instruments in their present condition set the standard for perfection in violin craftsmanship and sound, and violin makers all over the world try to come as close to this ideal as possible.

To this day, instruments from the "Golden Age" of violin making, especially those made by Stradivari and Guarneri del Gesù, are the most sought-after instruments by both collectors and performers.



The construction of a violin

A violin typically consists of a spruce top (the soundboard, also known as the top plate, table, or belly), maple ribs and back, two endblocks, a neck, a bridge, a soundpost, four strings, and various fittings, optionally including a chinrest, which may attach directly over, or to the left of, the tailpiece. A distinctive feature of a violin body is its "hourglass" shape and the arching of its top and back. The hourglass shape comprises two upper bouts, two lower bouts, and two concave C-bouts at the "waist," providing clearance for the bow.

The "voice" of a violin depends on its shape, the wood it is made from, the graduation (the thickness profile) of both the top and back, and the varnish which coats its outside surface. The varnish and especially the wood continue to improve with age, making the fixed supply of old violins much sought-after.

All parts of the instrument which are glued together are done so using animal hide glue, a traditional strong water-based adhesive that is reversible, as glued joints can be disassembled if needed. Weaker, diluted glue is usually used to fasten the top to the ribs, and the nut to the fingerboard, since common repairs involve removing these parts.

The purfling running around the edge of the spruce top provides some protection against cracks originating at the edge. It also allows the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Painted-on faux purfling on the top is a sign of an inferior instrument. The back and ribs are typically made of maple, most often with a matching striped figure, referred to as "flame," "fiddleback" or "tiger stripe"

The neck is usually maple with a flamed figure compatible with that of the ribs and back. It carries the fingerboard, typically made of ebony, but often some other wood stained or painted black. Ebony is the preferred material because of its hardness, beauty, and superior resistance to wear. Fingerboards are dressed to a particular transverse curve, and have a small lengthwise "scoop," or concavity, slightly more pronounced on the lower strings, especially when meant for gut or synthetic strings.

Some old violins (and some made to appear old) have a grafted scroll, evidenced by a glue joint between the pegbox and neck. Many authentic old instruments have had their necks reset to a slightly increased angle, and lengthened by about a centimeter. The neck graft allows the original scroll to be kept with a Baroque violin when bringing its neck into conformance with modern standards.

The bridge is a precisely cut piece of maple that forms the lower anchor point of the vibrating length of the strings and transmits the vibration of the strings to the body of the instrument. Its top curve holds the strings at the proper height from the fingerboard in an arc, allowing each to be sounded separately by the bow. The sound post, or "soul post," fits precisely inside the instrument between the back and top, below the treble foot of the bridge, which it helps support. It also transmits vibrations between the top and the back of the instrument.

The tailpiece anchors the strings to the lower bout of the violin by means of the tailgut, which loops around an ebony button called the tailpin (sometimes confusingly called "endpin" like the cello's spike), which fits into a tapered hole in the bottom block. Very often the E string will have a fine tuning lever worked by a small screw turned by the fingers. Fine tuners may also be applied to the other strings, especially on a student instrument, and are sometimes built into the tailpiece.

At the scroll end, the strings wind around the tuning pegs in the pegbox. Strings usually have a colored silk wrapping at both ends, for identification and to provide friction against the pegs. The tapered pegs allow friction to be increased or decreased by the player applying appropriate pressure along the axis of the peg while turning it.

Strings were first made of sheep gut (commonly known as catgut), stretched, dried and twisted. Modern strings may be gut, solid steel, stranded steel, or various synthetic materials, wound with various metals. Most E strings are unwound, either plain or gold-plated steel.

Violinists often carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks. Strings have a limited lifetime; apart from obvious things, such as the winding of a string coming undone from wear, a player will generally change a string when it no longer plays "true," with a negative effect on intonation, or when it loses the desired tone. The longevity of a string depends on how much and how intensely one plays.



The compass of the violin is from G3 (G below middle C) to C8 (the highest note of the modern piano.)  The top notes, however, are often produced by natural or artificial harmonics.




The arched shape, the thickness of the wood, and its physical qualities govern the sound of a violin. Patterns of the nodes made by sand or glitter sprinkled on the plates with the plate vibrated at certain frequencies, called "Chladni patterns," are occasionally used by luthiers to verify their work before assembling the instrument.



Children typically use smaller string instruments than adults. Violins are made in so-called "fractional" sizes for young students: Apart from full-size (4/4) violins, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/10, 1/16, and even 1/32-sized instruments exist. Extremely small sizes were developed, along with the Suzuki program for violin students as young as 3 years old. Finely-made fractional sized violins, especially smaller than 1/2 size, are extremely rare or nonexistent. Such small instruments are typically intended for beginners needing a rugged violin, and whose rudimentary technique does not justify the expense of a more carefully made one.

These fractional sizes have nothing to do with the actual dimensions of an instrument; in other words, a 3/4-sized instrument is not three-quarters the length of a full size instrument. The body length (not including the neck) of a "full-size" or 4/4 violin is about 14 inches (35 cm), smaller in some 17th century models. A 3/4 violin is about 13 inches (33 cm), and a 1/2 size is approximately 12 inches (30 cm). With the violin's closest family member, the viola, size is specified as body length in inches or centimeters rather than fractional sizes. A "full-size" viola averages 16 inches (40 cm).

Occasionally, an adult with a small frame may use a so-called "7/8" size violin instead of a full-size instrument.  Sometimes called a "lady's violin", these instruments are slightly shorter than a full size violin, but tend to be high-quality instruments capable of producing a sound that is comparable to fine full size violins.

Violin sizes are not standardized and dimensions vary slightly between makers.



Scroll and pegbox, correctly strung
The pitches of open strings on a violin
Violins are tuned by turning the pegs in the pegbox under the scroll, or by adjusting the fine tuner screws at the tailpiece. All violins have pegs; fine tuners (also called fine adjusters) are optional. Most fine tuners consist of a metal screw that moves a lever to which the string is attached. They permit very small pitch adjustments with much more ease than the pegs.

Fine tuners are usually used with solid metal or composite strings that may be difficult to tune with pegs alone; they are not used with gut strings, which are more elastic and do not respond adequately to the very small movements of fine tuners. Some violinists have fine tuners on all 4 strings; most classical players have only a single fine tuner on the E string.

To tune a violin, the A string is first tuned to a standard pitch (usually 440 Hz), using either a tuning device or another instrument. (When accompanying a fixed-pitch instrument such as a piano or accordion, the violin tunes to it.) The other strings are then tuned against each other in intervals of perfect fifths by bowing them in pairs. A minutely higher tuning is sometimes employed for solo playing to give the instrument a brighter sound; conversely, Baroque music is sometimes played using lower tunings to make the violin's sound more gentle. After tuning, the instrument's bridge may be examined to ensure that it is standing straight and centered between the inner nicks of the f-holes; a crooked bridge may significantly affect the sound of an otherwise well-made violin.

The tuning G-D-A-E is used for most violin music. Other tunings are occasionally employed; the G string, for example, can be tuned up to A. The use of nonstandard tunings in classical music is known as scordatura; in some folk styles, it is called "cross-tuning." One famous example of scordatura in classical music is Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre, where the solo violin's E string is tuned down to E flat to impart an eerie dissonance to the composition.  Another example would be in the third movement of Contrasts, by Béla Bartók, where the E string is tuned down to E flat and the G tuned to a G sharp.

In Indian classical music and Indian light music, the violin is likely to be tuned to D#-A#-D#-A# in the South Indian style. As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian classical music, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is F-Bb-F-Bb, which corresponds to Sa-Pa-Sa-Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style. In the North Indian "Hindustani" style, the tuning is usually Pa-Sa-Pa-Sa instead of Sa-Pa-Sa-Pa. This could correspond to Bb-F-Bb-F, for instance.

While most violins have four strings, there are some instruments with five strings,    six, or even seven. The extra strings on such violins typically are lower in pitch than the G-string; these strings are usually tuned to C, F, and B flat. If the instrument's playing length, or string length from nut to bridge, is equal to that of an ordinary full-scale violin i.e., a bit less than  , then it may be properly termed a violin. Some such instruments are somewhat longer and should be regarded as violas. Violins with five strings or more are often used in jazz or folk music.



  Archetier,   Bow makers
Bow frogs, top to bottom: violin, viola, cello
A violin is usually played using a bow consisting of a stick with a ribbon of horsehair strung between the tip and frog (or nut, or heel) at opposite ends. A typical violin bow may be 75 cm (29 inches) overall, and weigh about 60 g (2 oz). Viola bows may be about 5 mm (3/16") shorter and 10 g (1/3 oz) heavier.

At the frog end, a screw adjuster tightens or loosens the hair. Just forward of the frog, a leather thumb cushion and winding protect the stick and provide grip for the player's hand. The winding may be wire, silk, or whalebone (now imitated by alternating strips of yellow and black plastic.) Some student bows (particularly the ones made of solid fiberglass) substitute a plastic sleeve for grip and winding.

The hair of the bow traditionally comes from the tail of a "white" (technically, a grey) male horse, although some cheaper bows use synthetic fiber. Occasional rubbing with rosin makes the hair grip the strings intermittently, causing them to vibrate. The stick is traditionally made of brazilwood, although a stick made from this type of wood which is of a more select quality (and higher price) is referred to as pernambuco (both types are taken from the same tree species). Some student bows are made of fiberglass or various cheap woods.  Recent innovations have allowed carbon fiber to be used as a material for the stick at all levels of craftsmanship.




The standard way of holding the violin is with the left side of the jaw resting on the chinrest of the violin, and supported by the left shoulder, often assisted by a shoulder rest. This practice varies in some cultures; for instance, Indian (Carnatic and Hindustani) violinists play seated on the floor and rest the scroll of the instrument on the side of their foot. The strings may be sounded by drawing the hair of the bow across them (arco) or by plucking them (pizzicato). The left hand regulates the sounding length of the string by stopping it against the fingerboard with the fingertips, producing different pitches.

First Position Fingerings



As the violin has no frets to stop the strings, the player must know exactly where to place the fingers on the strings to play with good intonation. Through practice and ear training, the violinist's left hand finds the notes intuitively by muscle memory. Beginners sometimes rely on tapes placed on the fingerboard for proper left hand finger placement, but usually abandon the tapes quickly as they advance. Another commonly-used marking technique uses dots of white-out on the fingerboard, which wear off in a few weeks of regular practice. This practice, unfortunately, is used sometimes in lieu of adequate ear-training, guiding the placement of fingers  by eye and not by ear. Especially in the early stages of learning to play, the so-called "ringing tones" are useful. There are nine such notes in first position, where a stopped note sounds a unison or octave with another (open) string, causing it to vibrate sympathetically.

The fingers are conventionally numbered 1 (index) through 4 (little finger).  Especially in instructional editions of violin music, numbers over the notes may indicate which finger to use, with "0" indicating "open" string. The chart to the right shows the arrangement of notes reachable in first position. Not shown on this chart is the way the spacing between note positions becomes closer as the fingers move up (in pitch) from the nut.  The bars at the sides of the chart represent the usual possibilities for beginners' tape placements, at 1 st , high 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th  fingers.



The placement of the left hand on the fingerboard is characterized by "positions".  First position, where most beginners start (although some methods start in third position), is the most commonly used position in string music. The lowest note available in this position in standard tuning is an open G; the highest note in first position is played with the fourth finger on the E-string, sounding a B, or reaching up a half step (also known as the "extended fourth finger") to the C two octaves above middle C.

Moving the hand up the neck, so the first finger takes the place of the second finger, brings the player into second position. Letting the first finger take the first-position place of the third finger brings the player to third position, and so on. The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player, who may easily play more than two octaves on a single string, and four octaves on the instrument as a whole, although when a violinist has progressed to the point of being able to use the entire range of the instrument, references to particular positions become less common. Position names are mostly used for the lower positions and in method books; for this reason, it is uncommon to hear references to anything higher than fifth position. The lowest position on a violin is half-position, where the first finger is a half-step away from the nut. This position is less frequently used. The highest position, practically speaking, is 15 th  position.

The same note will sound substantially different, depending on what string is used to play it. Sometimes the composer or arranger will specify the string to be used in order to achieve the desired tone quality; this is indicated in the music by the marking, for example, sul G, meaning to play on the G string. For example, playing very high up on the lower strings gives a distinctive quality to the sound. Otherwise, moving into different positions is usually done for ease of playing.



Bowing or plucking an open string that is, a string played without any finger stopping it gives a different sound from a stopped string, since the string vibrates more freely at the nut than under a finger. Other than the low G (which can be played in no other way), open strings are generally avoided in some styles of classical playing. This is because they have a somewhat harsher sound (especially open E) and it is not possible to directly use vibrato on an open string. However, this can be partially compensated by applying vibrato on a note that is an octave higher than the open string.

In some cases playing an open string is called for by the composer (and explicitly marked in the music) for special effect, decided upon by the musician for artistic reasons (common in earlier works such as Bach), or played in a fast passage, where they usually cannot be distinguished.

Playing an open string simultaneously with a stopped note on an adjacent string produces a bagpipe-like drone, often used by composers in imitation of folk music. Sometimes the two notes are identical (for instance, playing a fingered A on the D string against the open A string), giving a ringing sort of "fiddling" sound. Playing an open string simultaneously with an identical stopped note can also be called for when more volume is required, especially in orchestral playing.




Double stopping is when two separate strings are stopped by the fingers, and bowed simultaneously, producing a chord. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary for the left hand to be able to reach both notes at once. Sounding an open string alongside a fingered note is another way to get a partial chord. While sometimes also called a double stop, it is more properly called a drone, as the drone note may be sustained for a passage of different notes played on the adjacent string. Three or four notes can also be played at one time (triple and quadruple stops, respectively), and, according to the style of music, the notes might all be played simultaneously or might be played as two successive double stops, favoring the higher notes. Playing the notes simultaneously is done by applying more pressure to the bow and/or bowing closer to the fingerboard.




Vibrato is a technique of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies in a pulsating rhythm. While various parts of the hand or arm may be involved in the motion, the end result is a movement of the fingertip bringing about a slight change in vibrating string length. Violinists oscillate backwards, or lower in pitch from the actual note when using vibrato, since perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound . Vibrato does little, if anything, to disguise an out-of-tune note: in other words, vibrato is a poor substitute for good intonation. Still, scales and other exercises meant to work on intonation are typically played without vibrato to make the work easier and  more effective. Music students are taught that unless otherwise marked in music, vibrato is assumed or even mandatory. This can be an obstacle to a classically-trained violinist wishing to play in a style that uses little or no vibrato at all, such as baroque music played in period style and many traditional fiddling styles.

Vibrato can be produced by a proper combination of finger, wrist and arm motions. One method, called "hand vibrato," involves rocking the hand back at the wrist to achieve oscillation, while another method, "arm vibrato," modulates the pitch by rocking at the elbow. A combination of these techniques allows a player to produce a large variety of tonal effects.

The "when" and "what for" of violin vibrato are artistic matters of style and taste. In acoustical terms, the interest that vibrato adds to the sound has to do with the way that the overtone mix (or tone color, or timbre) and the directional pattern of sound projection change with changes in pitch. By "pointing" the sound at different parts of the room in a rhythmic way, vibrato adds a "shimmer" or "liveliness" to the sound of a well-made violin. See  Schleske and  Weinreich.




Vibrato can also be used for a fast trill. A trill initiated from just hammering the finger up and down on the fingerboard will create a harsher quality than with a vibrato trill. For example, if trilling on the first finger, the second finger is placed very slightly off the string and vibrato is implemented. The second finger will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing the pitch to change. This has a softer quality and many think it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill. Note - this trill technique only works well for semi-tonal trills, it is far more difficult to vibrato trill for an interval of a tone or more.



Lightly touching the string with a fingertip at a harmonic node creates harmonics. Instead of the normal tone, a higher pitched note sounds.   Each node is at an integer division of the string, for example half-way or one-third along the length of the string. A responsive instrument will sound numerous possible harmonic nodes along the length of the string. Harmonics are marked in music either with a little circle above the note that determines the pitch of the harmonic, or by diamond-shaped note heads. There are two types of harmonics: natural harmonics and artificial harmonics (also known as "false harmonics").

Natural harmonics are played on an open string. The pitch of the open string is called the fundamental frequency.  Harmonics are also called overtones. They occur at whole-number multiples of the fundamental, which is called the first harmonic.  The second harmonic is the first overtone, the third harmonic is the second overtone, and so on. The second harmonic is in the middle of the string and sounds an octave higher than the string's pitch.  The third harmonic breaks the string into thirds and sounds an octave and a fifth above the fundamental, and the fourth harmonic breaks the string into quarters sounding two octaves above the first. The sound of the second harmonic is the clearest of them all, because it is a common node with all the succeeding even-numbered harmonics (4th, 6th, etc.). The third and succeeding odd-numbered harmonics are harder to play because they break the string into an odd number of vibrating parts and do not share as many nodes with other harmonics.

Artificial harmonics are more difficult to produce than natural harmonics, as they involve both stopping the string and playing a harmonic on the stopped note. Using the "octave frame" the normal distance between the first and fourth fingers in any given position with the fourth finger just touching the string a fourth higher than the stopped note produces the fourth harmonic, two octaves above the stopped note. Finger placement and pressure, as well as bow speed, pressure, and sounding point are all essential in getting the desired harmonic to sound. And to add to the challenge, in passages with different notes played as false harmonics, the distance between stopping finger and harmonic finger must constantly change, since the spacing between notes changes along the length of the string.

The "harmonic finger" can also touch at a major third above the pressed note (the fifth harmonic), or a fifth higher (a third harmonic).  These harmonics are less commonly used; in the case of the major third, both the stopped note and touched note must be played slightly sharp otherwise the harmonic does not speak as readily.  In the case of the fifth, the stretch is greater than is comfortable for many violinists. In the general repertoire fractions smaller than a sixth are not used.  However, divisions up to an eighth are sometimes used and, given a good instrument and a skilled player, divisions as small as a twelfth are possible.

There are a few books dedicated solely to the study of violin harmonics. Two comprehensive works are Henryk Heller's seven-volume Theory of Harmonics, published by Simrock in 1928, and Michelangelo Abbado's five-volume Tecnica dei suoni armonici published by Ricordi in 1934.

Elaborate passages in artificial harmonics can be found in virtuoso violin literature, especially of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Two notable examples of this are an entire section of Vittorio Monti's Csárdás and a passage towards the middle of the third movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto.



The right arm, hand, and bow are responsible for tone quality, rhythm, dynamics, articulation, and most (but not all) changes in timbre.



The most essential part of bowing technique is the bow grip. It is usually with the thumb bent in the small area between the frog and the winding of the bow. The other fingers are spread somewhat evenly across the top part of the bow.

The violin produces louder notes with greater bow speed or more weight on the string.  The two methods are not equivalent, because they produce different timbres; pressing down on the string tends to produce a harsher, more intense sound.

The sounding point where the bow intersects the string also influences timbre. Playing close to the bridge (sul ponticello) gives a more intense sound than usual, emphasizing the higher harmonics; and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard (sul tasto) makes for a delicate, ethereal sound, emphasizing the fundamental frequency. Dr. Suzuki referred to the sounding point as the "Kreisler highway"; one may think of different sounding points as "lanes" in the highway.

Various methods of 'attack' with the bow produce different articulations. There are many bowing techniques that allow for every range of playing style and many teachers, players, and orchestras spend a lot of time developing techniques and creating a unified technique within the group. These techniques include legato-style bowing, collé, ricochet, sautillé, martelé, spiccato, and staccato.



A note marked pizz. (abbreviation for pizzicato) in the written music is to be played by plucking the string with a finger of the right hand rather than by bowing. (The index finger is most commonly used here.) Sometimes in virtuoso solo music where the bow hand is occupied (or for show-off effect), left-hand pizzicato will be indicated by a "+" (plus sign) below or above the note.  In left-hand pizzicato, two fingers are put on the string; one (usually the index or middle finger) is put on the correct note, and the other (usually the ring finger or little finger) is put above the note. The higher finger then plucks the string while the lower one stays on, thus producing the correct pitch. By increasing the force of the pluck, one can increase the volume of the note that the string produces.



A marking of col legno (Italian for "with the wood") in the written music calls for striking the string(s) with the stick of the bow, rather than by drawing the hair of the bow across the strings.  This bowing technique is somewhat rarely used, and results in a muted percussive sound. The eerie quality of a violin section playing col legno is exploited in some symphonic pieces, notably the "Witches' Dance" of the last movement of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique.  Saint-Saens' symphonic poem "Danse Macabre" includes the string section using the col legno technique to imitate the sound of dancing skeletons. "Mars" from Gustav Holst's "The Planets" uses col legno to play a repeated rhythm in 5/4 time signature.  Some violinists, however, object to this style of playing as it can damage the finish and impair the value of a fine bow.



Literally "hammered", a strongly accented effect produced by releasing each bowstroke forcefully and suddenly. Martelé can be played in any part of the bow. It is sometimes indicated in written music by an arrowhead.



Very rapid repetition (typically of a single note, but occasionally of multiple notes), usually played at the tip of the bow.



Attaching a small metal, rubber, or wooden device called a "mute" to the bridge of the violin gives a softer, more mellow tone, with fewer audible overtones; the sound of an entire orchestral string section playing with mutes has a hushed quality. The conventional Italian markings for mute usage are con sord., or con sordina, "with mute", and senza sord., "without mute" or via sord., "mute out." Larger metal, rubber, or wooden mutes are available, known as "practice mutes" or "hotel mutes".  Such mutes are generally not used in performance, but are used to deaden the sound of the violin in practice areas such as hotel rooms. Some composers have used practice mutes for special effect, for example at the end of Luciano Berio's Sequenza VIII for solo violin.



Since the Baroque era, the violin has been one of the most important of all instruments in classical music, for several reasons.  The tone of the violin stands out above other instruments, making it appropriate for playing a melody line.  In the hands of a good player, the violin is extremely agile, and can execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes.

Violins make up a large part of an orchestra, and are usually divided into two sections, known as the first and second violins. Composers often assign the melody to the first violins, while second violins play harmony, accompaniment patterns or the melody an octave lower than the first violins. A string quartet similarly has parts for first and second violins, as well as a viola part, and a bass instrument, such as the cello or, rarely, the double bass.

String instruments have the ability to play in any pitch which, in the hands of great players, leads to wonderful range of harmonic colouring, making it possible for the instruments to be very expressive. This ability is at its finest in the string quartet literature where seamless changes from key to key and chord to chord create a kind of perfect harmonic world where even thirds ring with full resonance.



The earliest references to jazz performance using the violin as a solo instrument are documented during the first decades of the 20th century. The first great jazz violinist was Joe Venuti who is best known for his work with guitarist Eddie Lang during the 1920s. Since that time there have been many superb improvising violinists including Stéphane Grappelli, Stuff Smith, Regina Carter, Johnny Frigo, John Blake and Jean-Luc Ponty. While not primarily jazz violinists, Darol Anger and Mark O'Connor have spent significant parts of their careers playing jazz.

Violins also appear in ensembles supplying orchestral backgrounds to many jazz recordings.



Up to the 1970s, most types of popular music used bowed strings.  The hugely popular Motown recordings of the 1960s and 1970s relied heavily on strings as part of their trademark texture. Earlier genres of pop music, at least those separate from the rock and roll movement, tended to make use of fairly traditional orchestras, sometimes large ones; examples include the American "Crooners" such as Bing Crosby.  This carried through into 1970s disco music such as "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor and "Love's Theme" by Love Unlimited Orchestra.

The rise of electronically created music in the 1980s saw a decline in their use, as synthesized string sections took their place. However, while the violin has very little usage in rock music, it has some history in progressive rock (e.g. The Electric Light Orchestra, King Crimson,  Kansas) and has a stronger place in modern fusion bands, notably The Corrs.   The fiddle has also always been a part of British folk-rock music, as exemplified by the likes of Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span.

The popularity of crossover music beginning in the last years of the 20th century has brought the violin back into the popular music arena, with both electric and acoustic violins being used by popular bands.  Dave Matthews Band features violinist Boyd Tinsley.  The Flock featured violinist Jerry Goodman who later joined the jazz-rock fusion band, The Mahavishnu Orchestra. Yellowcard featured the instrument with a role equal to the guitar in many of their songs. Smashing Pumpkins are well-known for their violin-based sections. James' Saul Davies, who is also a guitarist, was enlisted by the band as a violinist. For their first three albums and related singles, the British group No-Man made extensive use of electric and acoustic solo violin as played by band member Ben Coleman (who played violin exclusively).

Independent artists such as Owen Pallet and Andrew Bird have also spurred increased interest in the instrument. Indie bands have often embraced new and unusual arrangements, allowing them more freedom to feature the violin than their mainstream brethren.  It has been used in the post-rock genre by bands such as Sigur Rós, Zox, Broken Social Scene, and A Silver Mt. Zion. The electric violin has even been used by bands like The Crüxshadows within the context of keyboard based music.

Indian and Arabic pop music is filled with the sound of violins, both soloists and ensembles.




The violin is a very important part of South Indian classical music (Karnatic music). It is believed to have been introduced to the South Indian tradition by Baluswamy Dikshitar. Though primarily used as an accompaniment instrument, the violin has become popular as a solo instrument in the orchestration. Popular film composers such as Ilaiyaraaja have used the violin extensively in film music scoring. This type of music was often played on a harmonic scale.



Hins-Anders painted by Anders Zorn, 1904
Like many other instruments used in classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors that were used for folk music.  Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well, ultimately spreading very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments. Ethnomusicologists have observed its widespread use in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

In many traditions of folk music, the tunes are not written but are memorized by successive generations of musicians and passed on, in what is known as the oral tradition.




When played as a folk instrument, the violin is ordinarily referred to in English as a fiddle (though the term "fiddle" may be used informally no matter what the genre of music). There is technically no difference between a fiddle and a violin. However, some folk fiddlers alter their instruments for various reasons. One example may be seen in American (e.g., bluegrass and old-time) fiddling: in these styles, the bridge is sometimes shaved down so that it is less curved. This makes it easier to play double stops and triple stops, allowing one to play chords with less effort. In addition, many fiddle players prefer to use a tailpiece with fine tuners on all four strings instead of only using one on the E string as many classical players do.




acoustic and electric violin
An electric violin is a violin equipped with an electric signal output of its sound, and is generally considered to be a specially constructed instrument which can either be:
* an electro-acoustic violin capable of producing both acoustic sound and electric signal
* an electric violin capable of producing only electric signal

To be effective as an acoustic violin, electro-acoustic violins retain much of the resonating body of the violin, often looking very much like, sometimes even identical to, an acoustic violin or fiddle.  They are often varnished with bright colours and made from alternative materials to wood.
The first specially built electric violins date back to the late 1930s and were made by Victor Pfeil, Oskar Vierling, George Eisenberg, Benjamin Miessner, George Beauchamp, Hugo Benioff and Fredray Kislingbury.  The majority of the first electric violinists were musicians playing jazz and popular music.




Violin authentication is the process of determining the maker and manufacture date of a violin. This process is similar to that used to determine the provenance of art works.  As significant value may be attached to violins made either by specific makers or at specific times and locations, forgery and other methods of fraudulent misrepresentation can be used to inflate the value of an instrument.

Trumpet



The trumpet is a musical instrument with the highest register in the brass family.    /ref> Trumpets are among the oldest musical instruments,

dating back to at least 1500 BC. They are constructed of brass tubing bent twice into an oblong shape, and are played by blowing air through closed lips, producing a "buzzing" sound which starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the trumpet.

There are several types of trumpet; the most common is a transposing instrument pitched in B . The predecessors to trumpets did not have valves; however, modern trumpets have either three piston valves or three rotary valves, each of which increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch.

The trumpet is used in many forms of music, including classical music and jazz.

The earliest trumpets date back to 1500 BC and earlier. The bronze and silver trumpets from Tutankhamun's grave in Egypt, bronze lurs from Scandinavia, and metal trumpets from China date back to this period. Edward Tarr, The Trumpet (Portland, Oregon: Amadeus Press, 1988), 20-30.  Trumpets from the Oxus civilization (3rd millennium BC) of Central Asia have decorated swellings in the middle, yet are made out of one sheet of metal, which is considered a technical wonder.

The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997.  The earliest trumpets were signaling instruments used for military or religious purposes, rather than music in the modern sense;

and the modern bugle continues this signaling tradition. 
Reproduction Baroque trumpet by Michael Laird
In medieval times, trumpet playing was a guarded craft, its instruction occurring only within highly selective guilds. The trumpet players were often among the most heavily guarded members of a troop, as they were relied upon to relay instructions to other sections of the army. Improvements to instrument design and metal making in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance led to an increased usefulness of the trumpet as a musical instrument. The development of the upper, "clarino" register by specialist trumpeters - notably Cesare Bendinelli - would lend itself well to the Baroque era, also known as the "Golden Age of the natural trumpet."

The melody-dominated homophony of the classical and romantic periods relegated the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers. Berlioz wrote in 1844:

"Notwithstanding the real loftiness and distinguished nature of its quality of tone, there are few instruments that have been more degraded (than the trumpet). Down to Beethoven and Weber, every composer - not excepting Mozart - persisted in confining it to the unworthy function of filling up, or in causing it to sound two or three commonplace rhythmical formulae." Berlioz, Hector (1844). Treatise on modern Instrumentation and Orchestration.  Edwin F. Kalmus, NY, 1948.

The trumpet was slow to adopt the modern valves (invented around the mid 1830s), and its cousin the cornet would take the spotlight as solo instrument for the next hundred years. Crooks and shanks (removable tubing of various lengths) as opposed to keys or valves were standard, notably in France, into the first part of the 20th century.



Trumpet valve bypass (depressed)
The trumpet is constructed of brass tubing bent twice into an oblong shape.

The trumpet and trombone share a roughly cylindrical bore which results in a bright, loud sound.  The bore is actually a complex series of tapers, smaller at the mouthpiece receiver and larger just before the flare of  the bell begins; careful design of these tapers is critical to the intonation of the instrument. By comparison, the cornet and flugelhorn have conical bores and produce a more mellow tone.

As with all brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through closed lips, producing a "buzzing" sound into the mouthpiece and starting a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the trumpet. The player can select the pitch from a range of overtones or harmonics by changing the lip aperture and tension (known as the embouchure). Modern trumpets also have three piston valves, each of which increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch. The first valve lowers the instrument's pitch by a whole step (2 semitones), the second valve by a half step (1 semitone), and the third valve by one-and-a-half steps (3 semitones).  When a fourth valve is present, as with some piccolo trumpets, it lowers the pitch a perfect fourth (5 semitones). Used singly and in combination these valves make the instrument fully chromatic, i.e., able to play all twelve pitches of Western music.  The sound is projected outward via the bell.

The trumpet's harmonic series is closely matched to the musical scale, but there are some notes in the series which are a compromise and thus slightly off key; these are known as wolf tones.  Some trumpets have a slide mechanism built in to compensate.

The mouthpiece has a circular rim which provides a comfortable environment for the lips' vibration.  Directly behind the rim is the cup, which channels the air into a much smaller opening (the back bore or shank) which tapers out slightly to match the diameter of the trumpet's lead pipe. The dimensions of these parts of the mouthpiece affect the timbre or quality of sound, the ease of playability, and player comfort. Generally, the wider and deeper the cup, the darker the sound and timbre.



The most common type is the B  trumpet, but C, D, E , E, F, G and A trumpets are also available.  The most common use of the C trumpet is in American orchestral playing, where it is used alongside the B  trumpet. Its slightly smaller size gives it a brighter, more lively sound. Because music written for early trumpets required the use of a different trumpet for each key — they did not have valves and therefore were not chromatic — and also because a player may choose to play a particular passage on a different trumpet from the one indicated on the written music, orchestra trumpet players are generally adept at transposing music at sight, sometimes playing music written for the B  trumpet on the C trumpet, and vice versa.

Piccolo trumpet in B , with swappable leadpipes to tune the instrument to B  (shorter) or A (longer)
Each trumpet's range extends from the written F  immediately below Middle C up to about three octaves higher. Standard repertoire rarely calls for notes beyond this range, and the fingering tables of most method books peak at the C (high C) two octaves above middle C.  Several trumpeters have achieved fame for their proficiency in the extreme high register, among them Lew Soloff, Andrea Tofanelli, Bill Chase, Maynard Ferguson, Roger Ingram, Wayne Bergeron, Anthony Gorruso,  Dizzy Gillespie, Jon Faddis, Cat Anderson, James Morrison, Doc Severinsen and Arturo Sandoval. It is also possible to produce pedal tones below the low F , although this technique is more often encountered as a sound-production exercise than as a written trumpet part.

The smallest trumpets are referred to as piccolo trumpets. The most common of these are built to play in both B  and A, with separate leadpipes for each key. The tubing in the B  piccolo trumpet is one-half the length of that in a standard B  trumpet. Piccolo trumpets in G, F and even C are also manufactured, but are rarer.  Many players use a smaller mouthpiece on the piccolo trumpet, which requires a different sound production technique from the B  trumpet and can limit endurance.  Almost all piccolo trumpets have four valves instead of the usual three — the fourth valve lowers the pitch, usually by a fourth, to facilitate the playing of lower notes.  Maurice André, Håkan Hardenberger, and Wynton Marsalis are some well-known piccolo trumpet players.
trumpet in C with rotary valves
Trumpets pitched in the key of G are also called sopranos, or soprano bugles, after their adaptation from military bugles.  Traditionally used in drum and bugle corps, sopranos have featured both rotary valves and piston valves.

The bass trumpet is usually played by a trombone player, being at the same pitch. Bass trumpet is played with a trombone or euphonium mouthpiece, and music for it is written in treble clef.

The modern slide trumpet is a B  trumpet that has a slide instead of valves. It is similar to a soprano trombone. The first slide trumpets emerged during the Renaissance, predating the modern trombone, and are the first attempts to increase chromaticism on the instrument. Slide trumpets were the first trumpets allowed in the Christian church. Tarr

The historical slide trumpet was probably first developed in the late fourteenth century for use in alta capella wind bands.  Deriving from early straight trumpets, the Renaissance slide trumpet was essentially a natural trumpet with a sliding leadpipe.  This single slide was rather awkward, as the entire corpus of the instrument moved, and the range of the slide was probably no more than a major third.  Originals were probably pitched in D, to fit with shawms in D and G, probably at a typical pitch standard near A=466.  As no instruments from this period are known to survive, the details - and even the existence - of a Renaissance slide trumpet is a matter of some conjecture, and there continues to be some debate among scholars.

Some slide trumpet designs saw use in England in the eighteenth century.

The pocket trumpet is a compact B  trumpet. The bell is usually smaller than a standard trumpet and the tubing is more tightly wound to reduce the instrument size without reducing the total tube length. Its design is not standardized, and the quality of various models varies greatly. It can have a tone quality and projection unique in the trumpet world: a warm sound and a voice-like articulation. Unfortunately, since many pocket trumpet models suffer from poor design as well as cheap and sloppy manufacturing, the intonation, tone color and dynamic range of such instruments are severely hindered. Professional-standard instruments are, however, available. While they are not a substitute for the full-sized instrument, they can be useful in certain contexts.

There are also rotary-valve, or German, trumpets, as well as alto and Baroque trumpets.

The trumpet is often confused with its close relative, the cornet, which has a more conical tubing shape compared to the trumpet's more cylindrical tube.  This, along with additional bends in the cornet's tubing, gives the cornet a slightly mellower tone, but the instruments are otherwise nearly identical.  They have the same length of tubing and, therefore, the same pitch, so music written for cornet and trumpet is interchangeable.  Another relative, the flugelhorn, has tubing that is even more conical than that of the cornet, and an even richer tone. It is sometimes augmented with a fourth valve to improve the intonation of some lower notes.



On any trumpet, cornet, or flugelhorn, pressing the valves indicated by the numbers below will produce the written notes shown - "OPEN" means all valves up, "1" means first valve, "1-2" means first and second valve simultaneously and so on. The concert pitch which sounds depends on the transposition of the instrument. Engaging the fourth valve, if present, drops any of these pitches by a perfect fourth as well. Within each overtone series, the different pitches are attained by changing the embouchure, or lip position and "firmness". Standard fingerings above high C are the same as for the notes an octave below (C  is 1-2, D is 1, etc.)

A step = a tone; a half step = a semitone

Note that the fundamental of each overtone series does not exist - the series begins with the first overtone. Notes in parentheses are the sixth overtone, representing a pitch with a frequency of seven times that of the fundamental; while this pitch is close to the note shown, it is slightly flat relative to equal temperament, and use of those fingerings is generally avoided.

The fingering schema arises from the length of each valve's tubing (a longer tube produces a lower pitch).  Valve "1" increases the tubing length enough to lower the pitch by one whole step, valve "2" by one half step, and valve "3" by one and a half steps.  This scheme and the nature of the overtone series create the possibility of alternate fingerings for certain notes.  For example, third-space "C" can be produced with no valves engaged (standard fingering) or with valves 2-3.  Also, any note produced with 1-2 as its standard fingering can also be produced with valve 3 - each drops the pitch by 1-1/2 steps.  Alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages. Extending the third valve slide when using the fingerings 1-3 or 1-2-3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation.

Famous jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie in 1988
The trumpet is used in many forms of music, though the most recognised players have been in the jazz field. Louis Armstrong, for example, was well known for his virtuosity with the trumpet. Armstrong's improvisations on his Hot Five and Hot Seven records were daring and sophisticated while also often subtle and melodic. Miles Davis is widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. His trumpet playing was  distinctive, with a vocal, clear tone that has been imitated by many. The phrasing and sense of space in his solos have been models for generations of jazz musicians.

Dizzy Gillespie was a trumpet virtuoso and gifted improviser, building on the style of Roy Eldridge but adding new layers of harmonic complexity. Gillespie had an enormous impact on virtually every subsequent trumpeter, both by the example of his playing and as a mentor to younger musicians. Maynard Ferguson came to prominence playing in Stan Kenton's orchestra, before forming his own band in 1957. He was noted for being able to play accurately in a remarkably high register.    While he was not the first trumpeter to play in the extreme upper register, he had a unique ability to play high notes with full, rich tone, power, and musicality.  While regarded by some as showboating, Ferguson's tone, phrasing and vibrato was instantly recognizable and has been influential on and imitated by generations of amateur and professional trumpet players.  A direct connection to Ferguson's style of playing continues in the work of the trumpeters who played with him, notably Roger Ingram, Wayne Bergeron, and Eric Miyashiro.  Although some had believed that Ferguson was endowed with exceptional facial musculature, he often shared in interviews that his command of the upper registers was based mostly on breath control,    something he had discovered as a youngster in Montreal.

Among the other great modern jazz trumpet players are Clifford Brown, Jon Faddis, Harry James, Wynton Marsalis, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, Chet Baker,  Arturo Sandoval, Doc Severinsen and Don Cherry.

Notable classical trumpeters include Maurice André, Roger Voisin, Armando Ghitalla, William Vacchiano, Adolph "Bud" Herseth, Charles Schlueter, Malcolm McNab, Sergei Nakariakov, Maurice Murphy, Hakan Hardenberger, Philip Smith, Rafael Méndez and Wynton Marsalis.

A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.




The trumpet is used in a wide range of musical styles including ska, ska punk, classical, jazz, Rock, Blues, pop, polka, cuban music, mariachi and funk.




The chromatic trumpet was first made in the late 1700s, but there were several solos written for the natural trumpet that are now played on piccolo trumpet; those old solos were of necessity high because the overtone series available to the natural trumpet only had stepwise notes at the top. Joseph Haydn's Trumpet Concerto was one of the first for a chromatic trumpet, Keith Anderson, liner notes for Naxos CD 8.550243, Famous Trumpet Concertos, "Haydn's concerto, written for Weidinger in 1796, must have startled contemporary audiences by its novelty. At the first performance of the new concerto in Vienna in 1800 a trumpet melody was heard in a lower register than had hitherto been practicable."  a fact shown off by some stepwise melodies played low in the instrument's range.

Drum

 
Bass drum made from wood, rope, and cowskin
The drum is a member of the percussion group, technically classified as a membranophone.  
 . Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with parts of a player's body, or with some sort of implement such as a drumstick, to produce sound. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the "Thumb roll".  Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.  
  Most drums are considered "untuned instruments", however many modern musicians are beginning to tune drums to songs; Terry Bozzio has constructed a kit using diatonic and chromatically tuned drums. A few such as timpani are always tuned to a certain pitch. Often, several drums are arranged together to create a drum kit that can be played by one musician with all four limbs    .



The shell almost invariably has a circular opening over which the drumhead is stretched, but the shape of the remainder of the shell varies widely. In the western musical tradition, the most usual shape is a cylinder, although timpani, for example, use bowl-shaped shells . Other shapes include a frame design (tar, Bodhrán), truncated cones (bongo drums, Ashiko), goblet shaped (djembe), and joined truncated cones (talking drum),

Drums with cylindrical shells can be open at one end (as is the case with timbales), or can have two drum heads. Single-headed drums normally consist of a skin which is stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum .

On modern band and orchestral drums, the drumhead is placed over the opening of the drum, which in turn is held onto the shell by a "counterhoop" (or "rim), which is then held by means of a number of tuning keyscrews called "tension rods" (also known as lugs) placed regularly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Many such drums have six to ten tension rods. The sound of a drum depends on several variables, including shape, size and thickness of its shell, materials from which the shell was made, counterhoop material, type of drumhead used and tension applied to it, position of the drum, location, and the velocity and angle in which it is struck.

Prior to the invention of tension rods drum skins were attached and tuned by rope systems such as that used on the Djembe or pegs and ropes such as that used on Ewe Drums, a system rarely used today, although sometimes seen on regimental marching band snare drums .

Several factors determine the sound a drum produces, including the type of shell the drum has, the type of drumheads it has, and the tension of the drumheads.  Different drum sounds have different uses in music. For example, a jazz drummer may want drums that sound crisp, clean, and a little on the soft side, whereas a rock and roll drummer may prefer drums that sound loud and deep. Because these drummers want different sounds, their drums will be constructed differently.

The drumhead has the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drumhead serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Thicker drumheads are lower-pitched and can be very loud. Drumheads with a white plastic coating on them muffle the overtones of the drumhead slightly, producing a less diverse pitch.  Drumheads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more.  And drumheads with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drumheads, preferring single ply drumheads or drumheads with no muffling.  Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drumheads.

The second biggest factor affecting the sound produced by a drum is the tension at which the drumhead is held against the shell of the drum.  When the hoop is placed around the drumhead and shell and tightened down with bolts, the tension of the head can be adjusted. When the tension is increased, the amplitude of the sound is reduced  and the frequency is increased, making the pitch higher and the volume lower.

The type of shell also affects the sound of a drum. Because the vibrations resonate in the shell of the drum, the shell can be used to increase the volume and to manipulate the type of sound produced. The larger the diameter of the shell, the lower the pitch of the drum will be.  The type of wood is important as well. Birch generates a bright, crisp, and clean sound, maple reproduces the frequency of the drumhead as it resonates and has a warm, wholesome sound while mahogany raises the frequency of low pitches and keeps higher frequencies at about the same speed. When choosing a set of shells, a jazz drummer may want smaller maple shells, while a rock drummer may want larger birch shells.

Drums are usually played by the hands, or by one or two sticks. In many traditional cultures drums have a symbolic function and are often used in religious ceremonies. Drums are often used in music therapy, especially hand drums, because of their tactile nature and easy use by a wide variety of people.

Within the realm of popular music and jazz, "drums" usually refers to a drum kit or a set of drums, and "drummer" to the actual band member or person who plays them.

In the past drums have been used not only for their musical qualities, but also as a means of communication, especially through signals. The talking drums of Africa can imitate the inflections and pitch variations of a spoken language and are used for communicating over great distances. Throughout Sri Lankan history drums have been used for communication between the state and the community, and Sri Lankan drums have a history stretching back over 2500 years. Chinese troops used tàigǔ drums to motivate troops, to help set a marching pace, and to call out orders or announcements . Fife-and-drum corps of Swiss mercenary foot soldiers also used drums. They used an early version of the snare drum carried over the player's right shoulder, suspended by a strap (typically played with one hand using traditional grip). It is to this instrument that English word "drum" was first used. Similarly, during the English civil war rope-tension drums would be carried by junior officers as a means to relay commands from senior officers over the noise of battle. These were also hung over the shoulder of the drummer and typically played with two drum sticks. Different regiments and companies would have distinctive and unique drum beats which only they would recognize.

Flute

 
A picture of a Western concert flute

The flute is a musical instrument of the woodwind family. Unlike other woodwind instruments, a flute is a reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air against an edge.

A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, a flautist, or a flutist.




The flute has been dated to prehistoric times. It has appeared in different forms and locations around the world. A three-holed flute made from a mammoth tusk (from the Geißenklösterle cave in the German Swabian Alb and dated to 30,000 to 37,000 years ago   ) was discovered in 2004, and two flutes made from swans' bones excavated a decade earlier (from the same cave in Germany, dated to circa 36,000 years ago) are among the oldest known musical instruments. A fragment of the femur of a juvenile cave bear, with two to four holes, found at Divje Babe in Slovenia and dated to about 43,100 years ago, may also be an early flute.     Flute History, UCLA. Retrieved June 2007.  
The Bible, in Genesis 4:21, cites Jubal as being the "father of all those who play the ugab and the kinnor". The former Hebrew term refers to some wind instrument, or wind instruments in general, the latter to a stringed instrument, or stringed instruments in general. As such, Jubal is traditionally regarded as the inventor of the flute (a word used in some translations of this biblical passage). Some early flutes were made out of tibias (shin bones). The flute has also always been an essential part of Indian culture and mythology,    and the cross flute believed by several accounts to originate in India       as Indian literature from 1500 BCE has made vague references to the cross flute.

Playable 9000-year-old Gudi (literally, "bone flute"), made from the wing bones of red-crowned cranes, with five to eight holes each, were excavated from a tomb in Jiahu  The bone age flute. BBC. Retrieved July 2007.  in the Central Chinese province of Henan.

The earliest extant transverse flute is a chi (篪) flute discovered in the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng at the Suizhou site, Hubei province, China. It dates from 433 BC, of the later Zhou Dynasty. It is fashioned of lacquered bamboo with closed ends and has five stops that are at the flute's side instead of the top. Chi flutes are mentioned in Shi Jing, compiled and edited by Confucius.




The pan flute was used in Greece from the 7th century BC, and spread to other parts of Europe.  A Worldwide History of the Pan Flute   Throughout the 10th, 12th and 13th centuries, transverse flutes were very uncommon in Europe, with the various fipple flutes being more prominent. The tin whistle (an Irish flute) first appeared in the 12th century, and the recorder in the 14th century. The first literary appearance of the transverse flute was made in 1285, but early on the instrument was only used in Germany and France.

Following the 16th-century court music, concert flutes began appearing in chamber ensembles. These flutes were often tuned to the key of D, and used as the tenor voice. However, these flutes varied greatly in size and range. The recorder continued to be popular during the renaissance, but its use declined in the 18th century. The later half of the 18th century shows the first orchestras being formed, and the concert flute being a member thereof, featured in symphonies and concertos. Throughout the rest of the 18th century the interest in concert flutes increased, and peaked in the early half of the 1800s.
In the 19th century, the ocarina was developed from the gemshorn, an instrument from the 16th century.

The 20th century saw a revival of the recorder, while the concert flute and tin whistle continued to be popular. The invention of plastics in the 20th century gave birth to the tonette, a fipple flute used in music education, but it soon fell out of use, replaced by plastic recorders.



A flute produces sound when a stream of air directed across a hole in the instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole.  Flute acoustics, UNSW. Retrieved June 2007.

The air stream across this hole creates a Bernoulli, or siphon, effect leading to a von Karman vortex street. This excites the air contained in the usually cylindrical resonant cavity within the flute. The player changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flute player can also change the pitch of a note by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic other than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes.

To be louder, a flute must use a larger resonator, a larger air stream, or increased air stream velocity. A flute's volume can generally be increased by making its resonator and tone holes larger. This is why a police whistle, a form of flute, is very wide for its pitch, and why a pipe organ can be far louder than a concert flute: a large organ pipe can contain several cubic feet of air, and its tone hole may be several inches wide, while a concert flute's air stream measures a fraction of an inch across.

The air stream must be directed at the correct angle and velocity, or else the air in the flute will not vibrate. In fippled or ducted flutes, a precisely formed and placed windway will compress and channel the air to the labium ramp edge across the open window. In the organ, this air is supplied by a regulated blower.

In non-fipple flutes, the air stream is shaped and directed by the player's lips, called the embouchure. This allows the player a wide range of expression in pitch, volume, and timbre, especially in comparison to fipple/ducted flutes. However, it also makes an end blown flute or transverse flute considerably more difficult for a beginner to produce a full sound than a ducted flute, such as the recorder. Transverse and end-blown flutes also take more air to play, which requires deeper breathing and makes circular breathing a considerably trickier proposition.

Generally, the quality called timbre or "tone colour" varies because the flute can produce harmonics in different proportions or intensities. The tone color can be modified by changing the internal shape of the bore, such as the conical taper, or the diameter-to-length ratio. A harmonic is a frequency that is a whole number multiple of a lower register, or "fundamental" note of the flute. Generally the air stream is thinner (vibrating in more modes), faster (providing more energy to excite the air's resonance), and aimed across the hole less deeply (permitting a more shallow deflection of the air stream) in the production of higher harmonics or upper partials.

Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone,     but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter.    Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney and any designed restriction in the "throat" of the instrument, such as that in the Japanese Nohkan Flute.

A study in which professional players were blindfolded could find no significant differences between instruments made from a variety of different metals.    In two different sets of blind listening, no instrument was correctly identified in a first listening, and in a second, only the silver instrument was identified. The study concluded that there was "no evidence that the wall material has any appreciable effect on the sound color or dynamic range of the instrument". Unfortunately, this study did not control for headjoint design, which is generally known to affect tone (see above). Controlled tone tests show that the tube mass does make a difference and therefore tube density and wall thickness will make a difference.    One must also consider the inefficiency of the human ear to detect sound, vs electronic sensors.



Playing the zampoña, a Pre-Inca instrument and type of pan flute.
In its most basic form, a flute can be an open tube which is blown like a bottle. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across the edge of the mouthpiece. However, some flutes, such as the whistle, gemshorn, flageolet, recorder, tin whistle, tonette, fujara, and ocarina have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a "fipple"). These are known as fipple flutes. The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.

Another division is between side-blown (or transverse) flutes, such as the Western concert flute, piccolo, fife, dizi, and bansuri; and end-blown flutes, such as the ney, xiao, kaval, danso, shakuhachi, Anasazi flute, and quena. The player of a side-blown flute uses a hole on the side of the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes should not be confused with fipple flutes such as the recorder, which are also played vertically but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole.

Flutes may be open at one or both ends. The ocarina, pan pipes, police whistle, and bosun's whistle are closed-ended. Open-ended flutes such as the concert flute and the recorder have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An organ pipe may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired.

Flutes can be played with several different air sources. Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The Flue pipes of Organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.




An illustration of a Western concert flute

The Western concert flute, a descendant of the 19th-century German flute, is a transverse flute which is closed at the top. Near the top is the embouchure hole, across and into which the player blows. It has larger circular finger-holes than its baroque predecessors, designed to increase the instrument's dynamic range. Various combinations can be opened or closed by means of keys, to produce the different notes in its playing range. There are a total of 25 working keys on a western concert flute. The note produced depends on which finger-holes are opened or closed and on how the flute is blown. There are two kinds of foot joints available for the concert flute: the standard C foot (shown above) or the longer B foot with an extra key extending the flute's range to B below middle C. There can also be a Bb below middle c foot joint added to the instrument. With the rare exception of the Kingma system, or custom-devised fingering systems, modern Western concert flutes conform to the Boehm system.

The standard concert flute is pitched in the key of C and has a range of three octaves starting from middle C (or one half-step lower with a B foot). This means that the concert flute is one of the highest common orchestral instruments, with the exception of the piccolo, which plays an octave higher. G alto and C bass flutes, pitched, respectively, a perfect fourth and an octave below the concert flute, are used occasionally. Parts are written for alto flute more frequently than for bass. The contrabass, double contrabass, and hyperbass are other rare forms of the flute pitched two, three, and four octaves below middle C respectively.

Other sizes of flute and piccolo are used from time to time. A rarer instrument of the modern pitching system is the treble G flute. Instruments made according to an older pitch standard, used principally in wind-band music, include Db piccolo, Eb soprano flute (the primary instrument, equivalent to today's concert C flute), F alto flute, and Bb bass flute.

A bansuri being played by an Indian classical music artist.
The bamboo flute is an important instrument in Indian classical music, and developed independently of the Western flute. The Hindu god Krishna is traditionally considered a master of the Bansuri (see below). The Indian flutes are very simple compared to the Western counterparts; they are made of bamboo and are keyless.

Pannalal Ghosh, a legendary Indian flutist, was the first to transform a tiny folk instrument to a bamboo flute (32 inches long with seven finger holes) suitable for playing traditional Indian classical music, and also to bring to it the stature of other classical music instruments. The extra hole permitted madhyam to be played, which facilitates the meends (like M N, P M and M D) in several traditional ragas.

Indian concert flutes are available in standard pitches. In Carnatic Music, the pitches are referred by numbers such as (assuming C as the tonic) 1 (for C), 1-1/2 (C#), 2 (D), 2-1/2 (D#), 3 (E), 4 (F), 4-1/2 (F#), 5 (G), 5-1/2 (G#), 6 (A), 6-1/2 (A#) and 7 (B). However, the pitch of a composition is itself not fixed and hence any of the flutes may be used for the concert (as long as the accompanying instruments, if any, are tuned appropriately) and is largely left to the personal preference of the artist.

Various type of flutes being sold by a boy in a local market in Bangalore, India
Two main varieties of Indian flutes are currently used. The first, the Bansuri, has six finger holes and one embouchure hole, and is used predominantly in the Hindustani music of Northern India. The second, the Venu or Pullanguzhal, has eight finger holes, and is played predominantly in the Carnatic music of Southern India. Presently, the 8-holed flute with cross-fingering technique is common among many Carnatic flutists. This technique was introduced by T. R. Mahalingam in the mid-20th century. Prior to this, the South Indian flute had only seven finger holes, with the fingering standard developed by Sharaba Shastri, of the Palladam school, at the beginning of the 20th century.    In 1998, based on his research on Bharata Natya Shastra's Sarana Chatushtai, Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan developed a methodology to produce perfectly tuned flutes for the ten thatas currently present in Indian classical music.

The quality of the flute's sound depends somewhat on the specific bamboo used to make it, and it is generally agreed that the best bamboo grows in the Nagarcoil area in South India.

The sring (also called blul) is a relatively small, end-blown flute with a nasal tone quality Pahlevanian 2001  and the pitch of a piccolo,  found in the Caucasus region of Eastern Armenia. It is made of wood or cane, usually with seven finger holes and one thumb hole,  producing a diatonic scale. The sring is used by shepherds to play various signals and tunes connected with their work, and also lyrical love songs called chaban bayaty, as well as programmatic pieces.  The sring is also used in combination with the def and the dohl to provide music for dancing.  One Armenian musicologist believes the sring to be the most characteristic of national Armenian instruments. Komitas 1994

Cymbal



Cymbals are a modern percussion instrument. Cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various cymbal alloys; see cymbal making for a discussion of their manufacture. Most modern cymbals are of indefinite pitch (tuned sets have been manufactured but are rare), whereas small cup-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (''see: crotales).

Cymbals are used in modern orchestras and many military, marching, concert and other bands. They are one of the two instrument types that form the modern drum kit, the other being the drum, and are a basic part of much contemporary music. The most basic drum kit normally contains at least one suspended cymbal and a pair of hi-hat cymbals.



The origins of cymbals can be traced back to prehistoric times. The ancient Egyptian cymbals closely resembled our own. The British Museum possesses two pairs, thirteen centimetres in diameter, one of which was found in the coffin of the mummy of Ankhhape, a sacred musician. Those used by the Assyrians were both plate- and cup-shaped, those of the Ancient Persians large-sized plates, made of brass, known as Sanj. The Greek cymbals were cup- or bell-shaped, and may be seen in the hands of innumerable fauns and satyrs in sculptures and on painted vases. The word cymbal is derived from the Latin cymbalum, which itself derives from the Greek word kumbalom, meaning a small bowl.



* Bell- The center of a Cymbal. When hit with the side or shoulder of a drum stick, it causes a sound which is in a higher register than the rest of the cymbal. 
* Bow- The remaining surface of the Cymbal. This is where you get a "ping" sound. 
* Edge or rim- This is where you get the best "crash". Hitting the edge causes the cymbal to vibrate more, thus being louder.



The most common Cymbals are the Hi-Hats, Crash, Splash, Ride, and China.



Although cymbals are not often required they form part of every orchestra; their chief use is for marking the rhythm, producing effects, or adding military color.  Their unique timbre allows them to project even against a full orchestra and through the heaviest of orhestrations. Cymbals have been utilized historically to suggest frenzy, fury or bacchanalian revels, as seen in the Venus music in Wagner's Tannhäuser, Grieg's Peer Gynt suite, and Osmin's aria "O wie will ich triumphieren" from Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail.



A pair of clash cymbals in profile. The bell is in green and the straps are in red.

Orchestral crash cymbals are traditionally used in pairs, each one having a strap set in the bell of the cymbal by which they are held. Such a pair is known technically as a pair of clash cymbals, although this term is rarely used, see clash cymbals. They are confusingly sometimes referred to simply as crash cymbals, although this term properly applies also to some suspended cymbals.

The sound can be obtained by rubbing their edges together in a sliding movement  for a "sizzle", striking them against each other in what is called a "crash", tapping the edge of one against the body of the other in what is called a "tap-crash", scraping the edge of one from the inside of the bell to the edge for a "scrape" or "zishend," or shutting the cymbals together and choking the sound in what is called a "hi-hat chick." A skilled player can obtain an enormous dynamic range from such a pair of cymbals. For example, in Beethoven's ninth symphony, one of their first appearances in an orchestral work, they make their entry pianissimo, adding a touch of colour rather than an almighty crash.

Clash cymbals are usually damped by pressing them against the player's body. A composer may write laissez vibrer, "Let vibrate" (usually abbreviated l.v.), secco (dry), or equivalent indications on the score; more usually, the player must judge exactly when to damp the cymbals based on the written duration of crash and the context in which it occurs.

Clash cymbals have traditionally been accompanied by the bass drum playing an identical part. This combination, played loudly, is an effective way to accentuate a note since the two instruments together contribute to both very low and very high frequency ranges and provide a satisfying "crash-bang-wallop". In older music the composer sometimes provided just one part for this pair of instruments, writing senza piatti or piatti soli (Italian: "without cymbals" or "cymbals only") if the bass drum is to remain silent. However, the modern convention is for the instruments to have independent parts.

Clash cymbals evolved into the low-sock and from this to the modern hi-hat. Even in a modern drum kit, they remain paired with the bass drum as the two instruments which are played with the player's feet. However, hi-hat cymbals tend to be heavy with little taper, more similar to a ride cymbal than to a crash cymbal as found in a drum kit, and perform a ride rather than a crash function.


 
The second main orchestral use of cymbals is the suspended cymbal. This instrument takes its name from the traditional method of suspending the cymbal by means of a leather strap or rope, thus allowing the cymbal to vibrate as freely as possible for maximum musical effect. Early jazz drumming pioneers borrowed this style of cymbal mounting during the early 1900s and later drummers further developed this instrument in to the mounted horizontal or nearly horizontally mounted "crash" cymbals of a modern drum kit.

Suspended cymbals are most often played with yarn wrapped mallets. However, some composers request other types of mallets like felt mallets or timpani beaters for different attack and sustain qualities. Suspended cymbals can produce bright and slicing tones when forcefully struck, and give an eerie transparent "windy" sound when played quietly. A tremolo, or roll (played with two mallets alternately striking on opposing sides of the cymbal) can build in volume from almost inaudible to an overwhelming climax in a satisfyingly smooth manner (as in Humperdink's Mother Goose Suite).

Furthermore, the edge of a suspended cymbal may be hit with shoulder of a drum stick to obtain a sound somewhat akin to that of a pair of clash cymbals. Other methods of playing include scraping a coin or a triangle beater rapidly across the ridges on the top of the cymbal, giving a "zing" sound (as in the fourth movement of Dvořák's Symphony No. 9). Other effects that can be used include drawing a cello or bass bow across the edge of the cymbal for a sound not unlike squealing car brakes.

On another note, in highschool marching bands, a "pit" may use a suspended cymbal for a song. This is held on a tree-like structure, similar to how it would be placed by a drumset. Also known as a high-top, the instrument's music will read it as a "sus. cym. or cymb."



Ancient cymbals or tuned cymbals are much more rarely called for. Their timbre is entirely different, more like that of small hand-bells or of the notes of the keyed harmonica. They are not struck full against each other, but by one of their edges, and the note given in by them is higher in proportion as they are thicker and smaller. Berlioz's Romeo and Juliet calls for two pairs of cymbals, modelled on some old Pompeian instruments no larger than the hand (some are no larger than a crown piece), and tuned to F and B flat. The modern instruments descended from this line are the crotales.

Guitar



The guitar is a musical instrument with ancient roots that is used in a wide variety of musical styles. It typically has six strings, but four, seven, eight,  ten and twelve string guitars also exist.

Guitars are recognized as one of the primary instruments in blues, country, flamenco, rock music, and many forms of pop. They can also be a solo classical instrument. Guitars may be played acoustically, where the tone is produced by vibration of the strings and modulated by the hollow body, or they may rely on an amplifier that can electronically manipulate tone. Such electric guitars were introduced in the 20th century and continue to have a profound influence on popular culture.

Traditionally guitars have usually been constructed of combinations of various woods and strung with animal gut, or more recently, with either nylon or steel strings. Guitars are made and repaired by luthiers.



Before the development of the electric guitar and the use of synthetic materials, a guitar was defined as being an instrument having "a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, most often with incurved sides". Kasha, Dr. Michael (August 1968). "A New Look at The History of the Classic Guitar". Guitar Review 30,3-12  Instruments similar to the guitar have been popular for at least 5,000 years. The six string  classical guitar first appeared in Spain but was itself the product of a long and complex history of diverse influences. Like virtually all other stringed European instruments, the guitar ultimately traces back thousands of years, via the Near East, to a common ancient origin from instruments then known in central Asia and India. It is distantly related with contemporary instruments such as the tanbur, setar, and the Indian sitar. The oldest known iconographic representation of an instrument displaying all the essential features of a guitar being played is a 3,300 year old stone carving of a Hittite bard. [A Brief History of the Guitar    The modern word, guitar, was adopted into English from Spanish guitarra (German Gitarre, French Guitare),    loaned from the Andalusian Arabic qitara    and Latin cithara, which in turn was derived from the earlier Greek word kithara, Kithara appears in the Greek New Testament four times (1 Cor. 14:7, Rev. 5:8, 14:2 and 15:2), and is usually translated into English as harp. Strong's Concordance Number:   2788    which is related to Old Persian sihtar.

The modern guitar is descended from the Roman cithara brought by the Romans to Hispania around 40 AD, and further adapted and developed with the arrival of the four-string oud, brought by the Moors after their conquest of the Iberian peninsula in the 8th century. Summerfield, Maurice J. (2003). The Classical Guitar, It's Evolution, Players and Personalities since 1800 (5th ed.) Blaydon on Tyne: Ashley Mark Publishing. ISBN 1-872-63946-1.  Elsewhere in Europe, the indigenous six-string Scandinavian lut (lute), had gained in popularity in areas of Viking incursions across the continent. Often depicted in carvings c. 800 AD, the Norse hero Gunther (also known as Gunnar), played a lute with his toes as he lay dying in a snake-pit, in the legend of Siegfried. [Viking Art & Architecture    By 1200 AD, the four string "guitar" had evolved into two types: the   (Moorish guitar) which had a rounded back, wide fingerboard and several soundholes, and the   (Latin guitar) which resembled the modern guitar with one soundhole and a narrower neck. [A Look At The History Of The Guitar

The Spanish vihuela or " ", a guitar-like instrument of the 15th and 16th centuries is, due to its many similarities, usually considered the immediate ancestor of the modern guitar. It had lute-style tuning and a guitar-like body. Its construction had as much in common with the modern guitar as with its contemporary four-course renaissance guitar. The vihuela enjoyed only a short period of popularity as it was superseded by the guitar; the last surviving publication of music for the instrument appeared in 1576. It is not clear whether it represented a transitional form or was simply a design that combined features of the Arabic oud and the European lute. In favor of the latter view, the reshaping of the vihuela into a guitar-like form can be seen as a strategy of differentiating the European lute visually from the Moorish oud.

The Vinaccia family of luthiers is known for developing the mandolin, and may have built the oldest surviving six string guitar. Gaetano Vinaccia (1759 – after 1831) The Classical Mandolin by Paul Sparks (1995)  has his signature on the label of a guitar built in Naples, Italy for six strings with the date of 1779.  Early Romantic Guitar  The Guitar and Its Music: From the Renaissance to the Classical Era by James Tyler (2002)  This guitar has been examined and does not show tell-tale signs of modifications from a double-course guitar although fakes are known to exist of guitars and identifying labels from that period.

The dimensions of the modern classical guitar (also known as the Spanish guitar) were established by Antonio Torres Jurado (1817-1892), working in Seville in the 1850s. Torres and Louis Panormo of London (active 1820s-1840s) were both responsible for demonstrating the superiority of fan strutting over transverse table bracing.



The guitar player (c. 1672), by Johannes Vermeer
Guitars can be divided into two broad categories, acoustic and electric:




An acoustic guitar is one not dependent on an external device to be heard but uses a soundboard which is a wooden piece mounted on the front of the guitar's body. The acoustic guitar is quieter than other instruments commonly found in bands and orchestras so when playing within such groups it is often externally amplified. Many acoustic guitars available today feature a variety of pickups which enable the player to amplify and modify the raw guitar sound.

There are several notable subcategories within the acoustic guitar group: classical and flamenco guitars; steel string guitars, which include the flat top or "folk" guitar; twelve string guitars and the arch top guitar. The acoustic guitar group also includes unamplified guitars designed to play in different registers such as the acoustic bass guitar which has a similar tuning to that of the electric bass guitar.

;Renaissance and Baroque guitars: These are the gracile ancestors of the modern classical guitar. They are substantially smaller and more delicate than the classical guitar, and generate a much quieter sound. The strings are paired in courses as in a modern 12 string guitar, but they only have four or five courses of strings rather than six. They were more often used as rhythm instruments in ensembles than as solo instruments, and can often be seen in that role in early music performances. (Gaspar Sanz' Instrucción de Música sobre la Guitarra Española of 1674 constitutes the majority of the surviving solo corpus for the era.) Renaissance and Baroque guitars are easily distinguished because the Renaissance guitar is very plain and the Baroque guitar is very ornate, with ivory or wood inlays all over the neck and body, and a paper-cutout inverted "wedding cake" inside the hole.

;Classical guitars: These are typically strung with nylon strings, played in a seated position and are used to play a diversity of musical styles including classical music. The classical guitar's wide, flat neck allows the musician to play scales, arpeggios and certain chord forms more easily and with less adjacent string interference than on other styles of guitar. Flamenco guitars are very similar in construction, but are associated with a more percussive tone. In Mexico, the popular mariachi band includes a range of guitars, from the tiny requinto to the guitarron, a guitar larger than a cello, which is tuned in the bass register. In Colombia, the traditional quartet includes a range of instruments too, from the small bandola (sometimes known as the Deleuze-Guattari, for use when traveling or in confined rooms or spaces), to the slightly larger tiple, to the full sized classical guitar. The requinto also appears in other Latin-American countries as a complementary member of the guitar family, with its smaller size and scale, permitting more projection for the playing of single-lined melodies. Modern dimensions of the classical instrument were established by Antonio Torres Jurado (1817-1892). Classical guitars are sometimes referred to as classic guitars. In recent years, the series of guitars used by the Niibori Guitar orchestra have gained some currency, namely:
;* Sopranino guitar (an octave and a fifth higher than normal); sometimes known as the piccolo guitar
;* Soprano guitar (an octave higher than normal)
;* Alto guitar (a 5th higher than normal)
;* Prime (ordinary classical) guitar
;* Niibori bass guitar (a 4th lower than normal); Niibori simply calls this the "bass guitar", but this assigns a different meaning to the term than other parts of the community use, as his is only a 4th lower, and has 6 strings
;* Contrabass guitar (an octave lower than normal)

;The modern Ten-string guitar:
The Modern/Yepes 10-string guitar (a classical guitar) adds four strings (resonators) tuned in such a way that they (along with the other three bass strings) can resonate in unison with any of the 12 chromatic notes that can occur on the higher strings; the idea behind this being an attempt at enhancing and balancing sonority.

;Portuguese guitar:
In spite of the name, it is not a guitar, but rather a cittern.

;Flat-top (steel-string) guitars: Similar to the classical guitar, however, within the varied sizes of the steel-stringed guitar the body size is usually significantly larger than a classical guitar and it has a narrower, reinforced neck and stronger structural design. This allows the instrument to withstand the additional tension of steel strings. The steel strings produce a brighter tone, and according to many players, a louder sound. The acoustic guitar is used in many kinds of music including folk, country, bluegrass, pop, jazz and blues.

;Archtop guitars: These are steel string instruments in which the top (and often the back) of the instrument are carved in a curved rather than a flat shape. Lloyd Loar of the Gibson Guitar Corporation introduced the violin-inspired f-hole design now usually associated with archtop guitars, after designing a style of mandolin of the same type. The typical archtop is a deep, hollow body guitar whose form is much like that of a mandolin or violin family instrument. Nowadays, most archtops are equipped with magnetic pickups and are therefore both acoustic and electric. F-hole archtop guitars were immediately adopted upon their release by both jazz and country musicians and have remained particularly popular in jazz music, usually with flatwound strings.

Ellis 8 string baritone tricone resonator guitar.
;Resonator, resophonic or Dobro guitars: Similar to the flat top guitar in appearance, the sound of the resonator guitar is produced by a metal resonator mounted in the middle of the top. The physical principle of the guitar is therefore similar to the banjo. The original purpose of the resonator was to amplify the sound of the guitar. This purpose has been largely superseded by electrical amplification, but the resonator guitar is still played because of its distinctive sound. Resonator guitars may have either one resonator cone or three resonator cones. Three-cone resonators have two cones on the left above one another and one cone immediately to the right. The method of transmitting sound resonance to the cone is either a "biscuit" bridge, made of a small piece of hardwood, or a "spider" bridge, made of metal and larger in size. Three-cone resonators always use a specialized metal spider bridge. The type of resonator guitar with a neck with a square cross-section – called "square neck" – is usually played face up, on the lap of the seated player, and often with a metal or glass slide. The round neck resonator guitars are normally played in the same fashion as other guitars, although slides are also often used, especially in blues.

;12 string guitars: The twelve string guitar usually has steel strings and is widely used in folk music, blues and rock and roll. Rather than having only six strings, the 12-string guitar has six courses made up of two strings each, like a mandolin or lute. The highest two courses are tuned in unison, while the others are tuned in octaves. The 12-string guitar is also made in electric forms.

;Russian guitars: These are seven string acoustic guitars which were the norm for Russian guitarists throughout the 19th and well into the 20th centuries. The guitar is traditionally tuned to an open G major tuning.

;Acoustic bass guitars: Have steel strings or gut strings and often the same tuning as an electric bass guitar.

;Tenor guitars: A number of classical guitarists call the Niibori prime guitar a "Tenor Guitar" on the grounds that it sits in pitch between the alto and the bass. Elsewhere  the name is taken for a 4-string guitar with a scale length of 23" (585 mm) – about the same as a Terz Guitar. The tenor guitar is tuned in fifths, C G D A, as is the tenor banjo and the cello. It is generally accepted   that the tenor guitar was created to allow a tenor banjo player to follow the fashion as it evolved from Dixieland Jazz towards the more progressive Jazz that featured guitar. It allows a tenor banjo player to provide a guitar-based rhythm section with little to learn. A small minority of players (such as Nick Reynolds of the Kingston Trio) close tuned the instrument to D G B E to produce a deep instrument that could be played with the 4-note chord shapes found on the top 4 strings of the guitar or ukulele. The deep pitch warrants the wide-spaced chords that the banjo tuning permits, and the close tuned tenor does not have the same full, clear sound.

;Harp guitars: Harp Guitars are difficult to classify as there are many variations within this type of guitar. They are typically rare and uncommon in the popular music scene. Most consist of a regular guitar, plus additional 'harp' strings strung above the six normal strings. The instrument is usually acoustic and the harp strings are usually tuned to lower notes than the guitar strings, for an added bass range. Normally there is neither fingerboard nor frets behind the harp strings. Some harp guitars also feature much higher pitch strings strung below the traditional guitar strings. The number of harp strings varies greatly, depending on the type of guitar and also the player's personal preference (as they have often been made to the player's specification).  /ref> The Pikasso guitar; 4 necks, 2 sound holes, 42 strings] and also the Oracle Harp Sympitar; 24 strings (with 12 sympathetic strings protruding through the neck) are modern examples.

;Extended-range guitars: For well over a century guitars featuring seven, eight, nine, ten or more strings have been used by a minority of guitarists as a means of increasing the range of pitch available to the player. Usually, it is bass strings that are added. Classical guitars with an extended range are useful for playing lute repertoire, some of which was written for lutes with more than six courses.

;Guitar battente: The battente is smaller than a classical guitar, usually played with four or five metal strings. It is mainly used in Calabria (a region in southern Italy) to accompany the voice.

This Fender Stratocaster has features common to many electric guitars: multiple pickups, a whammy bar, volume and tone knobs.




Electric guitars can have solid, semi-hollow, or hollow bodies, and produce little sound without amplification. Electromagnetic pickups convert the vibration of the steel strings into electrical signals which are fed to an amplifier through a cable or radio transmitter. The sound is frequently modified by other electronic devices or the natural distortion of valves (vacuum tubes) in the amplifier. There are two main types of pickup, single and double coil (or humbucker), each of which can be passive or active. The electric guitar is used extensively in jazz, blues, and rock and roll, and was commercialized by Gibson in collaboration with Les Paul, and independently by Leo Fender of Fender Music. The lower fretboard action (the height of the strings from the fingerboard) and its electrical amplification lend the electric guitar to some techniques which are less frequently used on acoustic guitars. These include tapping, extensive use of legato through pull-offs and hammer-ons (also known as slurs), pinch harmonics, volume swells, and use of a tremolo arm or effects pedals.

Seven-strings were popularized in the 1980s and 1990s in part due to the release of the Ibanez Universe guitar, endorsed by Steve Vai. Other artists go a step further, by using an 8 string guitar with two extra low strings. Although the most common 7-string has a low B string, Roger McGuinn (of The Byrds and Rickenbacker) uses an octave G string paired with the regular G string as on a 12 string guitar, allowing him to incorporate chiming 12 string elements in standard 6 string playing.

The electric bass guitar is similar in tuning to the traditional double bass viol.
Hybrids of acoustic and electric guitars are also common. There are also more exotic varieties, such as guitars with two, three,  The Official Steve Vai Website - www.vai.com > The Machines > Steve's Guitars   or rarely four necks, all manner of alternate string arrangements, fretless fingerboards (used almost exclusively on bass guitars, meant to emulate the sound of a stand-up bass), 5.1 surround guitar, and such.

Some electric guitar and electric bass guitar models feature Piezoelectric pickups, which function as transducers to provide a sound closer to that of an acoustic guitar with the flip of a switch or knob, rather than switching guitars.

Guitars can be constructed to meet the demands of both left and right-handed players. Traditionally the dominant hand is assigned the task of plucking or strumming the strings. For the majority of people this entails using the right hand. This is because musical expression (dynamics, tonal expression and colour etc) is largely determined by the plucking hand, while the fretting hand is assigned the lesser mechanical task of depressing and gripping the strings. This is similar to the convention of the violin family of instruments where the right hand controls the bow. A minority, however, believe that left-handed people should learn to play guitars strung in the manner used by right-handed people, simply to standardise the instrument.




The headstock is located at the end of the guitar neck furthest from the body. It is fitted with machine heads that adjust the tension of the strings, which in turn affects the pitch. Traditional tuner layout is "3+3" in which each side of the headstock has three tuners (such as on Gibson Les Pauls). In this layout, the headstocks are commonly symmetrical. Many guitars feature other layouts as well, including six-in-line (featured on Fender Stratocasters) tuners or even "4+2" (Ernie Ball Music Man). However, some guitars (such as Steinbergers) do not have headstocks at all, in which case the tuning machines are located elsewhere, either on the body or the bridge.




The nut is a small strip of bone, plastic, brass, corian, graphite, stainless steel, or other medium-hard material, at the joint where the headstock meets the fretboard. Its grooves guide the strings onto the fretboard, giving consistent lateral string placement. It is one of the endpoints of the strings' vibrating length. It must be accurately cut, or it can contribute to tuning problems due to string slippage, and/or string buzz.




Also called the fingerboard, the fretboard is a piece of wood embedded with metal frets that comprises the top of the neck. It is flat on classical guitars and slightly curved crosswise on acoustic and electric guitars. The curvature of the fretboard is measured by the fretboard radius, which is the radius of a hypothetical circle of which the fretboard's surface constitutes a segment. The smaller the fretboard radius, the more noticeably curved the fretboard is. Most modern guitars feature a 12" neck radius, while older guitars from the 1960s and 1970s usually feature a 6-8" neck radius. Pinching a string against the fretboard effectively shortens the vibrating length of the string, producing a higher pitch. Fretboards are most commonly made of rosewood, ebony, maple, and sometimes manufactured or composite materials such as HPL or resin. See below on section "Neck" for the importance of the length of the fretboard in connection to other dimensions of the guitar.




Frets are metal strips (usually nickel alloy or stainless steel) embedded along the fretboard and located at exact points that divide the scale length in accordance with a specific mathematical formula. Pressing a string against a fret determines the strings' vibrating length and therefore its resultant pitch. The pitch of each consecutive fret is defined at a half-step interval on the chromatic scale. Standard classical guitars have 19 frets and electric guitars between 21 to 24 frets (though Ibanez has issued guitars with as many as 36 frets.)

Frets are laid out to a mathematical ratio that results in equal tempered division of the octave. The ratio of the spacing of two consecutive frets is the twelfth root of two. The twelfth fret divides the scale length in two exact halves and the 24th fret position divides the scale length in half yet again. Every twelve frets represents one octave. In practice, luthiers determine fret positions using the constant 17.817, which is derived from the twelfth root of two. The scale length divided by this value yields the distance from the nut to the first fret. That distance is subtracted from the scale length and the result is divided in two sections by the constant to yield the distance from the first fret to the second fret. Positions for the remainder of the frets are calculated in like manner.

There are several different fret gauges, which can be fitted according to player preference. Among these are "jumbo" frets, which have much thicker gauge, allowing for use of a slight vibrato technique from pushing the string down harder and softer. "Scalloped" fretboards, where the wood of the fretboard itself is "scooped out" between the frets allows a dramatic vibrato effect. Fine frets, much flatter, allow a very low string-action but require other conditions such as curvature of the neck to be well maintained in order to prevent buzz.

On steel-string guitars, frets are eventually bound to wear down; when this happens, frets can be replaced or, to a certain extent, leveled, polished, recrowned, or reshaped as required.




The truss rod is a metal rod that runs along the inside of the neck. It is used to correct changes to the neck's curvature caused by the neck timbers aging, changes in humidity or to compensate for changes in the tension of strings. The tension of the rod and neck assembly is adjusted by a hex nut or an allen-key bolt on the rod, usually located either at the headstock, sometimes under a cover, or just inside the body of the guitar underneath the fretboard and accessible through the sound hole. Some truss rods can only be accessed by removing the neck. The truss rod counteracts the immense amount of tension the strings place on the neck, bringing the neck back to a straighter position. Turning the truss rod clockwise will tighten it, counteracting the tension of the strings and straightening the neck or creating a backward bow. Turning the truss rod counter-clockwise will loosen it, allowing string tension to act on the neck and creating a forward bow. Adjusting the truss rod affects the intonation of a guitar as well as the height of the strings from the fingerboard, called the action. Some truss rod systems, called "double action" truss systems, tighten both ways, allowing the neck to be pushed both forward and backward (standard truss rods can only be released to a point beyond which the neck will no longer be compressed and pulled backward). Classical guitars do not require truss rods as their nylon strings exert a lower tensile force with lesser potential to cause structural problems.

Inlays are visual elements set into the exterior surface of a guitar. The typical locations for inlay are on the fretboard, headstock, and on acoustic guitars around the soundhole, known as the rosette. Inlays range from simple plastic dots on the fretboard to intricate works of art covering the entire exterior surface of a guitar (front and back). Some guitar players have used LEDs in the fretboard to produce a unique lighting effects onstage.

Fretboard inlays are most commonly shaped like dots, diamond shapes, parallelograms, or large blocks in between the frets. Dots are usually inlaid into the upper edge of the fretboard in the same positions, small enough to be visible only to the player. Some older or high-end instruments have inlays made of mother of pearl, abalone, ivory, coloured wood or other exotic materials and designs. Simpler inlays are often made of plastic or painted. High-end classical guitars seldom have fretboard inlays as a well trained player is expected to know his or her way around the instrument.

In addition to fretboard inlay, the headstock and soundhole surround are also frequently inlaid. The manufacturer's logo or a small design is often inlaid into the headstock. Rosette designs vary from simple concentric circles to delicate fretwork mimicking the historic rosette of lutes. Bindings that edge the finger and sound boards are sometimes inlaid. Some instruments have a filler strip running down the length and behind the neck, used for strength and/or to fill the cavity through which the trussrod was installed in the neck.

Elaborate inlays are a decorative feature of many limited edition, high-end and custom-made guitars. Guitar manufacturers often release such guitars to celebrate significant or historic milestones.




A guitar's frets, fretboard, tuners, headstock, and truss rod, all attached to a long wooden extension, collectively constitute its neck. The wood used to make the fretboard will usually differ from the wood in the rest of the neck. The bending stress on the neck is considerable, particularly when heavier gauge strings are used (see Tuning), and the ability of the neck to resist bending (see Truss rod) is important to the guitar's ability to hold a constant pitch during tuning or when strings are fretted. The rigidity of the neck with respect to the body of the guitar is one determinant of a good instrument versus a poor one. The shape of the neck can also vary, from a gentle "C" curve to a more pronounced "V" curve. There are many different types of neck profiles available, giving the guitarist many options.
Some aspects to consider in a guitar neck may be the overall width of the fingerboard, scale (distance between the frets), the neck wood, the type of neck construction (for example, the neck may be glued in or bolted on), and the shape (profile) of the back of the neck. Other type of material used to make guitar necks are graphite (Steinberger guitars), aluminium (Kramer Guitars, Travis Bean and Veleno guitars), or carbon fiber (Modulus Guitars and ThreeGuitars).

Double neck electric guitars have two necks, allowing the musician to quickly switch between guitar sounds.




This is the point at which the neck is either bolted or glued to the body of the guitar. Almost all acoustic guitars, with the primary exception of Taylors, have glued (otherwise known as set) necks, while electric guitars are constructed using both types.

Commonly used set neck joints include mortise and tenon joints (such as those used by CF Martin & Co. guitars), dovetail joints (also used by CF Martin on the D28 and similar models) and Spanish heel neck joints which are named after the shoe they resemble and commonly found in classical guitars. All three types offer stability. Bolt-on necks, though they are historically associated with cheaper instruments, do offer greater flexibility in the guitar's set-up, and allow easier access for neck joint maintenance and repairs.

Another type of neck, only available for solid body electric guitars, is the neck-through-body construction. These are designed so that everything from the machine heads down to the bridge are located on the same piece of wood. The sides (also known as wings) of the guitar are then glued to this central piece. Some luthiers prefer this method of construction as they claim it allows better sustain of each note. Some instruments may not have a neck joint at all, having the neck and sides built as one piece and the body built around it.




Modern guitar strings are constructed of metal, polymers, or animal or plant product materials.

Instruments utilising "steel" strings may have strings made of alloys incorporating steel, nickel or phosphor bronze. Classical and flamenco instruments historically used gut strings, but these have been superseded by polymer materials, such as nylon and fluorocarbon materials. Bass strings for both instruments are wound rather than monofilament.




In acoustic guitars, string vibration is transmitted through the bridge and saddle to the body via sound board. The sound board is typically made of tone woods such as spruce or cedar. Timbers for tone woods are chosen for both strength and ability to transfer mechanical energy from the strings to the air within the guitar body. Sound is further shaped by the characteristics of the guitar body's resonant cavity.

In electric guitars, transducers known as pickups convert string vibration to an electric signal, which in turn is amplified and fed to speakers, which vibrate the air to produce the sound we hear. Nevertheless, the body of the electric guitar still performs a role in shaping the resultant tonal signature.

In an acoustic instrument, the body of the guitar is a major determinant of the overall sound quality. The guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element made of tonewoods such as spruce and red cedar. This thin piece of wood, often only 2 or 3mm thick, is strengthened by differing types of internal bracing. The top is considered by many luthiers to be the dominant factor in determining the sound quality. The majority of the instrument's sound is heard through the vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it.

Body size, shape and style has changed over time. 19th century guitars, now known as salon guitars, were smaller than modern instruments. Differing patterns of internal bracing have been used over time by luthiers. Torres, Hauser, Ramirez, Fleta, and C.F. Martin were among the most influential designers of their time. Bracing not only strengthens the top against potential collapse due to the stress exerted by the tensioned strings, but also affects the resonance characteristics of the top. The back and sides are made out of a variety of timbers such as mahogany, Indian rosewood and highly regarded Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra). Each one is primarily chosen for their aesthetic effect and can be decorated with inlays and purfling.

The body of an acoustic guitar has a sound hole through which sound is projected. The sound hole is usually a round hole in the top of the guitar under the strings. Air inside the body vibrates as the guitar top and body is vibrated by the strings, and the response of the air cavity at different frequencies is characterised, like the rest of the guitar body, by a number of resonance modes at which it responds more strongly.

Instruments with larger areas for the guitar top were introduced by Martin in an attempt to create louder volume levels. The popularity of the larger "dreadnought" body size amongst acoustic performers is related to the greater sound volume produced.




Most electric guitar bodies are made of wood and include a plastic pick guard. Boards wide enough to use as a solid body are very expensive due to the worldwide depletion of hardwood stock since the 70's, so the wood is rarely one solid piece. Most bodies are made of two pieces of wood with some of them including a seam running down the centre line of the body. The most common woods used for electric guitar body construction include maple, basswood, ash, poplar, alder, and mahogany. Many bodies will consist of good sounding but inexpensive woods, like ash, with a "top", or thin layer of another, more attractive wood (such as maple with a natural "flame" pattern) glued to the top of the basic wood. Guitars constructed like this are often called "flame tops". The body is usually carved or routed to accept the other elements, such as the bridge, pickup, neck, and other electronic components. Most electrics have a polyurethane or nitrocellulose lacquer finish.
Other alternative materials to wood, are used in guitar body construction. Some of these include carbon composites, plastic material (such as polycarbonate) and aluminium alloys.




Pickups are transducers attached to a guitar that detect (or "pick up") string vibrations and convert the mechanical energy of the string into electrical energy. The resultant electrical signal can then be electronically amplified. The most common type of pickup is electromagnetic in design. These contain magnets that are tightly wrapped in a coil, or coils, of copper wire. Such pickups are usually placed right underneath the guitar strings. Electromagnetic pickups work on the same principles and in a similar manner to an electrical generator. The vibration of the strings causes a small voltage to be created in the coils surrounding the magnets; this signal voltage is later amplified.

Traditional electromagnetic pickups are either single-coil or double-coil. Single-coil pickups are susceptible to noise induced from electric fields, usually mains-frequency (60 or 50 hertz) hum. The introduction of the double-coil humbucker in the mid-1950s did away with this problem through the use of two coils, one of which is wired in a reverse polarity orientation.

The types and models of pickups used can greatly affect the tone of the guitar. Typically, humbuckers, which are two magnet–coil assemblies attached to each other are traditionally associated with a heavier sound. Single-coil pickups, one magnet wrapped in copper wire, are used by guitarists seeking a brighter, twangier sound with greater dynamic range.

Modern pickups are tailored to the sound desired. A commonly applied approximation used in selection of a pickup is that less wire (lower DC resistance) = brighter sound, more wire = "fat" tone. Other options include specialized switching that produces coil-splitting, in/out of phase and other effects. Guitar circuits are either active, needing a battery to power their circuit, or, as in most cases, equipped with a passive circuit.

Fender Stratocaster type guitars generally utilize three single-coil pickups, while most Gibson Les Paul types use humbucker pickups.

Piezoelectric, or piezo, pickups represent another class of pickup. These employ piezoelectricity to generate the musical signal and are popular in hybrid electro-acoustic guitars. A crystal is located under each string, usually in the saddle. When the string vibrates, the shape of the crystal is distorted, and the stresses associated with this change produce tiny voltages across the crystal that can be amplified and manipulated.

Some piezo-equipped guitars use what is known as a hexaphonic pickup.  "Hex" is a prefix meaning six. In a hexaphonic pickup separate outputs are obtained from discrete piezoelectric pickups for each of the six strings. This arrangement allows the signal to be easily modified by on-board modelling electronics, as in the Line 6 Variax brand of electric guitars; the guitars allow for a variety of different sounds to be obtained by digitally manipulating the signal. This allows a guitar to mimic many vintage models of guitar, as well as output alternate tunings without the need to adjust the strings.

Another use for hexaphonic pickups is to send the output signals to a MIDI interpretation device, which determines the note pitch, duration, attack and decay characteristics and so forth. The MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) interpreter then sends the note information to a sound bank device. The resulting sound can closely mimic numerous types of instruments.



On guitars that have them, these components and the wires that connect them allow the player to control some aspects of the sound like volume or tone. These at their simplest consist of passive components such as potentiometers and capacitors, but may also include specialized integrated circuits or other active components requiring batteries for power, for preamplification and signal processing, or even for assistance in tuning. In many cases the electronics have some sort of shielding to prevent pickup of external interference and noise.




The top, back and ribs of an acoustic guitar body are very thin (1-2 mm), so a flexible piece of wood called lining is glued into the corners where the rib meets the top and back. This interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20 mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints. Solid linings are often used in classical guitars, while kerfed lining is most often found in steel string acoustics. Kerfed lining is also called kerfing (because it is scored, or kerfed to allow it to bend with the shape of the rib).

During final construction, a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and then filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding, which are called purfling. This binding serves to seal off the endgrain of the top and back. Purfling can also appear on the back of an acoustic guitar, marking the edge joints of the two or three sections of the back.

Binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or plastic.




The main purpose of the bridge on an acoustic guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the soundboard, which vibrates the air inside of the guitar, thereby amplifying the sound produced by the strings.

On both electric and acoustic guitars, the bridge holds the strings in place on the body. There are many varied bridge designs. There may be some mechanism for raising or lowering the bridge to adjust the distance between the strings and the fretboard (action), and/or fine-tuning the intonation of the instrument. Some are spring-loaded and feature a "whammy bar", a removable arm which allows the player to modulate the pitch moving the bridge up and down. The whammy bar is sometimes also referred to as a "tremolo bar" (see Tremolo for further discussion of this term – the effect of rapidly changing pitch produced by a whammy bar is more correctly called "vibrato"). Some bridges also allow for alternate tunings at the touch of a button.

On almost all modern electric guitars, the bridge is adjustable for each string so that intonation stays correct up and down the neck. If the open string is in tune but sharp or flat when frets are pressed, the bridge can be adjusted with a screwdriver or hex key to remedy the problem. In general, flat notes are corrected by moving the bridge forward and sharp notes by moving it backwards. On an instrument correctly adjusted for intonation, the actual length of each string from the nut to the bridge saddle will be slightly but measurably longer than the scale length of the instrument. This additional length is called compensation, which flattens all notes a bit to compensate for the sharping of all fretted notes caused by stretching the string during fretting.




Also known as a scratchplate. This is usually a piece of laminated plastic or other material that protects the finish of the top of the guitar from damage due to the use of a plectrum or fingernails. Electric guitars sometimes mount pickups and electronics on the pickguard. It is a common feature on steel-string acoustic guitars. Vigorous performance styles such as flamenco, which can involve the use of the guitar as a percussion instrument, call for a scratchplate to be fitted to nylon-string instruments.




The Vibrato (pitch bend) unit found on many electric guitars has also had slang terms applied to it, such as "tremolo bar (or arm)", "sissy bar", "wang bar", "slam handle", "whammy handle", and "whammy bar". The latter two slang terms led stompbox manufacturers to use the term 'whammy' in coming up with a pitch raising effect introduced by popular guitar effects pedal brand "Digitech".

Leo Fender, who did much to create the electric guitar, also created much confusion over the meaning of the terms "tremolo" and "vibrato", specifically by misnaming the "tremolo" unit on many of his guitars and also the "vibrato" unit on his "Vibrolux" amps. In general, vibrato is a variation in pitch, whereas tremolo is a variation in volume, so the tremolo bar is actually a vibrato bar and the "Vibrolux" amps actually had a tremolo effect. However, following Fender's example, electric guitarists traditionally reverse these meanings when speaking of hardware devices and the effects they produce. See vibrato unit for a more detailed discussion, and tremolo arm for more of the history.

A distinctly different form of mechanical vibrato found on some guitars is the Bigsby vibrato tailpiece, commonly called Bigsby. This vibrato wraps the strings around a horizontal bar, which is then rotated with a handle by the musician.

Another type of pitch bender is the B-Bender, a spring and lever device mounted in an internal cavity of a solid body electric, guitar that allows the guitarist to bend just the B string of the guitar using a lever connected to the strap handle of the guitar. The resulting pitch bend is evocative of the sound of the pedal steel guitar.

Self-tuning guitars are computerized guitars programmed to tune themselves.  The Gibson Robot guitar, released in 2007, was the first of this kind.  Gibson is currently working on a new self-tuning model called the Dark Fire.




The guitar is a transposing instrument. Its pitch sounds one octave lower than it is notated on a score.

A variety of different tunings may be used. However, the most common by far is known as "Standard Tuning," which has the strings tuned from a low E, to a high E, traversing a two octave range – EADGBE.

The pitches are as follows:

The table below shows pitch names found over the six strings of a guitar in standard tuning, from the nut (zero), to the twelfth fret.

A table to depict pitch names found over the six strings of a guitar in standard tuning, from the nut (zero), to the twelfth fret.

A guitar using this tuning can tune to itself using the fact, with a single exception, that the 5th fret on one string is the same note as the next open string; that is, a 5th-fret note on the sixth string is the same note as the open fifth string. The exception is the interval between the second and third strings, in which the 4th-fret note on the third string is equivalent to the open second string.

Standard tuning has evolved to provide a good compromise between simple fingering for many chords and the ability to play common scales with minimal left hand movement. Uniquely, the guitar's tuning allows for repeatable patterns which also facilitates the ease in which common scales can be played.    There are also a variety of commonly used alternate tunings – most of which are open tunings that create entire chord voicings without fretting any strings. Many open tunings, where all of the strings are tuned to a similar note or chord, are popular for slide guitar playing. Alternate tunings are used for two main reasons: the ease of playing and the variation in tone that can be achieved.

Many guitarists use a long established, centuries-old tuning variation where the lowest string is 'dropped' two semi-tones down. Known as Drop-D (or dropped D) tuning it is, from low to high, DADGBE. This allows for open string tonic and dominant basses in the keys of D and D minor. It also enables simple fifths (powerchords) to be more easily played. Eddie Van Halen sometimes uses a device known as a 'D Tuna,' the patent for which he owns. It is a small lever, attached to the fine tuner of the 6th string on a Floyd Rose tremolo, which allows him to easily drop that string's tuning to a D. Many contemporary rock bands detune all strings by several semi-tones, making, for example, Drop-C or Drop-B tunings, However this terminology is inconsistent with that of "drop-D" as "drop-D" refers to dropping a single string to the named pitch. Often these new tunings are also simply referred to as the "Standard" of the note in question e.g. – "D Standard" (DGcfad').

Some guitarists tune in straight fourths, avoiding the major third between the third and second strings. While this makes playing major and minor triads slightly more difficult, it facilitated playing chords with more complicated extended structures . One proponent of the straight fourth tuning (EADGCF) is Stanley Jordan.

As with all stringed instruments a large number of scordatura are possible on the guitar. A common form of scordatura involves tuning the 3rd string to F# to mimic the standard tuning of the lute, especially when playing renaissance repertoire originally written for the lute.



Though a guitar may be played on its own, there are a variety of common accessories used for holding and playing the guitar.




A capo (short for capotasto) is used to change the pitch of open strings. Capos are clipped onto the fret board with the aid of spring tension, or in some models, elastic tension. To raise the guitar's pitch by one semitone, the player would clip the capo onto the fret board just below the first fret. Their use allows a player to play in different keys without having to change the chord formations they use. Because of the ease with which they allow guitar players to change keys, they are sometimes referred to as "cheaters" or the "hillbilly crutch." Classical performers are known to use them to enable modern instruments to match the pitch of historical instruments such as the renaissance lute.




A slide, (neck of a bottle, knife blade or round metal bar) used in blues and rock to create a glissando or 'hawaiian' effect. The necks of bottles were often used in blues and country music. Modern slides are constructed of glass, plastic, ceramic, chrome, brass or steel, depending on the weight and tone desired. An instrument that is played exclusively in this manner, (using a metal bar) is called a steel guitar or pedal steel. Slide playing to this day is very popular in blues music and country music. Some slide players use a so called Dobro guitar.

Some performers that have become famous for playing slide are Robert Johnson, Elmore James, Ry Cooder, George Harrison, Bonnie Raitt, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, Duane Allman, Muddy Waters and Rory Gallagher.




A variety of guitar picksA "guitar pick" or "plectrum" is a small piece of hard material which is generally held between the thumb and first finger of the picking hand and is used to "pick" the strings. Though most classical players pick solely with their finger nails, the "pick" is often used for electric and some acoustic guitars. Though today they are mainly plastic, variations do exist, such as bone, wood, steel or tortoise shell. Tortoise shell was the most commonly used material in the early days of pick making but as tortoises became more and more endangered, the practice of using their shells for picks or anything else was banned. Tortoise shell picks are often coveted for a supposedly superior tone and ease of use.

Picks come in many shapes and sizes. Picks vary from the small jazz pick to the large bass pick. The thickness of the pick often determines its use. A thinner pick (between .2 and .5 mm) is usually used for strumming or rhythm playing, whereas thicker picks (between .7 and 1.5+ mm) are usually used for single-note lines or lead playing. The distinctive guitar sound of Billy Gibbons is attributed to using a quarter or peso as a pick. Similarly, Brian May is known to use a sixpence coin as a pick. Retired session musician David Persons is known for using old credit cards, cut to the correct size, as plectrum.

Thumb picks and finger picks that attach to the finger tips are sometimes employed in finger-picking styles.

Xylophone



The xylophone (from the Greek words ξύλον -  xylon, "wood" + φωνή - phone, "voice", meaning "wooden sound") is a musical instrument in the percussion family which probably originated in Indonesia. Nettl, Bruno, "Music in Primitive Culture", Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-59000-7, p 98(1956)  It consists of wooden bars of various lengths that are struck by plastic, wooden, or rubber mallets. Each bar is tuned to a specific pitch of the musical scale. Xylophone can refer to western style concert xylophones or to one of the many wooden mallet percussion instruments found around the world. Xylophones are tuned to different scale systems depending on their origin, including pentatonic, heptatonic, diatonic, or chromatic. The arrangement of the bars is generally from low (longer bars) to high (shorter bars).



Gusikow's 'wood and straw instrument', from Lewald's 'Europa'
The xylophone is an ancient instrument that originated independently in Africa and Asia. Wooden bars were originally seated on a series of hollow gourds, and the gourds generated the resonating notes that are produced on modern instruments by metal tubes. For centuries, xylophone makers struggled with methods of tuning the wooden bars. Old methods consisted of arranging the bars on tied bundles of straw, and, as still practiced today, placing the bars adjacent to each other in a ladder-like layout. Ancient mallets were made of willow wood with spoon-like bowls on the beaten ends.

Java and Bali use xylophones (called gambang) in gamelan ensembles. Still have traditional significance in Africa, Malaysia, Melanasia, Center Valley, Indonesia, and regions of the Americas.

It is likely that the xylophone reached Europe during the Crusades and the earliest historical reference in Europe is in 16th Century Germany in organist Arnold Schlick's Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten.   Vienna Symphonic Library Online   The earliest known model was from the 9th Century in southeast Asia  (However, a model of a hanging wood instrument exists, dated to ca. 2000 BC in China.)

The xylophone, which had been known in Europe since the Middle Ages, was by the 19th Century associated largely with the folk music of Eastern Europe, notably Poland and Eastern Germany. By 1830, the xylophone had been popularized to some extent by a Russian virtuoso named Michael Josef Gusikov,  Michael Joseph Guzikow Archives 
who through extensive tours had made the instrument known.  His instrument was the five-row “continental style” xylophone made of 28 crude wooden bars, arranged in semi-tones in the form of a trapezoid, and resting on straw supports.  It was sometimes called the “strohfiedel” or “straw fiddle”.  There were no resonators and it was played with spoon shaped sticks.  According to musicologist, Curt Sachs, Gusikov performed in garden concerts, variety shows, and as a novelty at symphony concerts. Certainly in the 1830’s a xylophone solo was a novelty.  Noted musicians, including Felix Mendelssohn, Frederic Chopin, and Franz Liszt spoke very highly of Gusikov’s performances.  Perhaps due to his great influence, xylophonists continued to be featured in theater shows and concert halls until well into the 20th century

The xylophone is a precursor to the vibraphone, which was developed in the 1920s.

Other forms of "xylophone" include xylophonist, and xylophoning.




2000BC – First xylophone artifacts:   Wood harmonicon with 16 suspended wood bars found in China   Xylophone-like 'ranat' of Hindi regions.  Numerous temple reliefs of musicians playing xylophones support these evidences.

1300 – First written account

1500 – First brought to Europe, and then Latino countries by African slaves between   1500-1700A.D. It evolved in Central and South America into the marimba.

1511 – First European mention by German composer Arnolt Schlick; also  listed by Praetorius in his catalogue of musical instruments (a.k.a.,  Strohfideln, or Hulzen G'lachter, or Gigelyra, or straw fiddle )

1866, April 7 – The word xylophone is coined, recorded in the Athenaeum: "A prodigy ... who does wonderful things with little drumsticks o­n a machine of wooden keys, called the 'xylophone.’"

1874  – The first usage of the European-derived orchestral by Charles Camille Saint-Saens in 'Danse Macabre'.

1910 – 1940  golden age, a favorite in vaudeville and ragtime.   Famous xylophonists of the era include George Cary, George Hamilton Green, and Harry Breuer.   It was displaced in jazz by the vibraphone.



The modern western-style xylophone has bars made of rosewood or more commonly, kelon, an extremely durable fiberglass that allows a louder sound at the expense of tone quality. Some xylophones can be as small as 2 1/2 octaves but concert xylophones are typically 3 1/2 or 4 octaves.

Concert xylophones have resonators below the bars to enhance the tone and sustain. Frames are made of wood or cheap steel tubing; more expensive xylophones feature height adjustment and more stability in the stand.

In other music cultures, xylophones have wooden bars and a wooden frame. Some versions have resonators made of gourds.



Western-style xylophones are characterised by a bright, sharp tone and high register. Modern xylophones include resonating tubes below the bars. A xylophone with a range extending downwards into the marimba range is called a xylorimba.

Cello



The violoncello (abbreviated to cello, or  'cello,  plural cellos or celli—the c is  , as in the ch in "check", thus "chel-lo") is a bowed string instrument. A person who plays a cello is called a cellist. The cello is used as a solo instrument, in chamber music, and as a member of the string section of an orchestra.



Study of a three-quarter size cello.
The name Cello is an abbreviation of the Italian violoncello, which means "little violone", referring to the violone ("big viol"), the lowest-pitched instrument of the viol family, the group of string instruments that were superseded by the violin family. Thus, the name carries both an augmentative "-one" ("big") and a diminutive "-cello" ("little"). Cellos are tuned in fifths, starting with C2 (two octaves below middle C) as the lowest string, followed by G2, D3, and A3. It is tuned the same way as the viola, only an octave lower.

The cello is most closely associated with European classical music, and has been described as the closest sounding instrument to the human voice.  Welcome::. to Academic Journals Inc   The instrument is a part of the standard orchestra and is the bass voice of the string quartet, as well as being part of many other chamber groups. A large number of concertos and sonatas have been written for the cello. The instrument is less common in popular music, but is sometimes featured in pop and rock recordings. The cello has also recently appeared in major hip-hop and R & B performances, such as singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo's performance at the American Music Awards.    The instrument has also been modified for Indian classical music by Nancy Lesh and Saskia Rao-de Haas.

Among the most well-known Baroque works for the cello are J. S. Bach's six unaccompanied Suites. From the Classical era, the two concertos by Joseph Haydn in C major and D major stand out, as do the five sonatas for cello and pianoforte of Beethoven which span the important three periods of his compositional evolution. Romantic era repertoire includes the Schumann Concerto, the Dvořák Concerto as well as the two sonatas and the Double Concerto by Brahms. Compositions from the early 20th century include Elgar's Cello Concerto in E minor, Debussy's Sonata for Cello and Piano and unaccompanied cello sonatas by Zoltán Kodály and Paul Hindemith. The cello's versatility made it popular with composers in the mid- to late twentieth century such as Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Britten, Ligeti and Dutilleux, encouraged by soloists who specialized in contemporary music (such as Siegfried Palm and Mstislav Rostropovich) commissioning from and collaborating with composers.



The violoncello da spalla (sometimes "violoncello piccolo da spalla" or "violoncello da span") was the first cello referred to in print (by Jambe de Fer in 1556). Delbanco, Nicholas. (January 1, 2001) Harper's Bazaar.  The Countess of Stanlein Restored. (Violoncello owned by Bernard Greenhouse is restored). Volume 302; Issue 1808; Page 39.  "Violone" means a larger "viola" (viol), while "-cello" in Italian is a diminutive and spalla means "shoulder" in Italian so that violoncello da spalla suggest a "little big violin" that may be held on the shoulder so that the player could perform while walking or that the early, short-necked instrument was hung across the shoulder by a strap.  By the turn of the twentieth century, it had grown customary to abbreviate the name violoncello to 'cello, with the apostrophe indicating the six missing prefix letters.  It now is acceptable to use the name "cello" without the apostrophe and as a full designation.



The cello is typically made from wood, although other materials such as carbon fiber or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a spruce top, with maple for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as poplar  willow, are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of laminated wood.

The top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the bridge and sound holes just below the middle.

The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as purfling.  Purfling looks attractive, but is not just for decoration.  If a cello is dropped or bumped against something so that damage occurs, the purfling can stop cracks from forming.  A crack may form at the rim of the instrument, but will spread no further.  Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back.  Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place.  Less expensive instruments typically have the purfling painted on.

Cello manufacturer Luis & Clark constructs cellos from carbon fiber.  Carbon fiber instruments are particularly suitable for outdoor playing because of the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an untold number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins). An advertisement published in N.Y. Music Service catalogue (1930) reads: "...made entirely of aluminum with the exception of the fingerboard. They have many advantages over the wood basses and violoncellos, as they cannot crack, split or warp and are made to last forever ... possessing a tone quality that is deep, resonant and responsive to the utmost degree. Violoncello $150."



Above the main body is the carved neck, which leads to a pegbox and the scroll. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood. Attached to the neck and extending over the body of the instrument is the fingerboard. The nut is a raised piece of wood, where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, which the strings rest on. The pegbox houses four tuning pegs, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The scroll is a traditional part of the cello and all other members of the violin family. Ebony is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hard woods, such as boxwood or rosewood, can be used.



Strings on a cello have cores made out of gut, metal, or synthetic materials, such as Perlon. Most modern strings used today are also wound with metallic materials like aluminum, titanium and chromium. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments.



The tailpiece and endpin are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of ebony or another hard wood, but can also be made of plastic or steel. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The endpin or spike is made of wood, metal or rigid carbon fiber and supports the cello in playing position. In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves. Around the 1830s, the Belgian cellist Auguste Adrien Servais introduced the endpin and propagated its use. Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word "endpin" sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called "tailpin".) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor.




The bridge of a cello, with a mute
The bridge holds the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The f-holes, named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process. The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier.



Internally, the cello has two important features: a bass bar, which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden sound post, which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a diaphragm to produce the instrument's sound.



Cellos are constructed and repaired using hide glue, which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it will let go, avoiding a crack in the plate.



A cello bow.
Traditionally, bows are made from pernambuco or brazilwood. Both come from the same species of tree (Caesalpina echinata), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity  which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows.

Bows are also made from other materials, such as carbon-fiber-stronger than wood-and fiberglass(often used to make inexpensive, low-quality student bows). An average cello bow is 73 cm long (shorter than a violin or viola bow) 3 cm high (from the frog to the stick) and 1.5 cm wide. The frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow, but is wider. A cello bow is roughly 10 grams heavier than a viola bow, which in turn is roughly 10 grams heavier than a violin bow.

Bow hair is traditionally horsehair, though synthetic hair in varying colors is also used. Prior to playing, a musician-in this case a cellist-tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. Rosin is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. Ideally a bow should be re-haired every year, but this is not in great practice because of cost.



The cello developed from the bass violin, first referred to by Jambe de Fer in 1556, which was originally a three-string instrument. The first instance of a composer specifying the bass violin may have been Gabrieli in Sacrae symphoniae, 1597.  Monteverdi referred to the instrument as "basso de viola da braccio" in Orfeo (1607). Although the first bass violin, possibly invented by Amati as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consorts with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a "violone," or "large viola," as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the viola de gamba appear in Italian art of the early 1500s...

The invention of wire-wound strings (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in Bologna, allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play virtuosic passages. This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by basses or violones.

Around 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France.   Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size in order to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern cello as developed by Stradivari, who also made a number of old pattern large cello's (the 'Servais'). Cyr 1982  The bass violin remained the "most used" instrument in England as late as 1740, where the violoncello was still "not common." Grassineau 1740  The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time.  The size was not standardized until around 1750.

Despite similarities to the viola da gamba, the cello is actually part of the viola da braccio family, meaning "viol of the arm", which includes, among others, the violin and viola. Though paintings like Bruegel's "The Rustic Wedding" and de Fer in his Epitome Musical suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic a gamba position eventually replaced them entirely.

A cello strung with gut strings. Note the absence of fine-tuning pins on the tailpiece.
Baroque era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor), while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of gut, with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello, resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.

No educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. The earliest cello manual is Michel Corrette's Méthode, thèorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection (Paris, 1741).



Seated Cellist


The cello is usually played while seated. Its weight is supported mainly by its endpin or spike, which rests on the floor. Sometimes, an endpin support is needed to prevent the endpin from slipping on smooth surfaces. The cello is steadied on the lower bout between the knees of the seated player, and on the upper bout against the upper chest. The neck of the cello is above the player's left shoulder, and the C-String tuning peg is just behind the left ear. The bow is drawn horizontally across the strings. In early times, female cellists sometimes played side-saddle, since it was considered improper for a lady to part her knees in public. A player's handedness does not alter the way the cello is held or used. In exceedingly rare cases the cello has been played in a mirror-image posture: this is usually because of a physical disability of one of the player's arms or hands which makes the required technique impossible for that side of the body. In such a situation, the player must decide whether or not to reverse the set-up of the cello (the string positions, bass-bar, sound post, fingerboard shape, and bridge carving are all asymmetrical).



The position of the left hand fingers along the strings determine the pitch of the note. The closer to the bridge that the string is depressed, the higher in pitch will be the resulting sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the neck positions (which use just less than half of the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in thumb position (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.



Vibrato is a small oscillation in the pitch of a note, usually considered expressive. It is created by a partial rotation of the upper arm at the shoulder joint, which translates into a linear oscillation of the lower arm. The fixed point of contact of the fingertip on the string absorbs this motion by rocking back and forth. It is this change in the attitude of the fingertip to the string which causes the pitch to vary. Vibrato is a key expressive device, and a well-developed vibrato technique is an essential element of a modern cellist's skill. In some styles of music, such as that of the Romantic period, vibrato may be used on almost every note. However, in other styles, such as Baroque repertoire, vibrato is used only rarely, as an ornament. In any case, the choice of whether to use vibrato, and how much, is normally a stylistic decision on the part of the player. Typically, the lower the pitch of the note played, the wider and slower the vibrato.



Harmonics played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes that are part of the harmonic series for the string on which they occur. Artificial harmonics (also called False harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any notes above middle C. They usually appear with the touching note a perfect fourth above the stopped note, which produces a sound two octaves above the stopped note, although other intervals are available. All harmonics produce a distinctive flute-like sound, and are usually performed without vibrato.



Glissando ("sliding", in Italian) is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string. This causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly, without separate, discernible steps.



In cello playing, the bow is much like the breath of a wind instrument player. Arguably, it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing. The right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes. The bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge, in a direction perpendicular to the strings. The bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand, the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist's body. The shape of the hand should resemble that of its relaxed state, with all fingers curved, including the thumb. The transmission of weight from the arm to the bow happens through the pronation (inward rotation) of the forearm, which pushes the index finger and to a lesser degree the middle finger onto the bow. The necessary counterforce is provided by the thumb. Depending upon the school of training, the other two fingers are used in various degrees to help maintain the angle of the bow to the string and are critical to controlling the bow when it is off the string. (See also spiccato).

In English, the terminology for bow direction (down and up) can be misleading. A downbow is drawn to the right of the player, and an upbow to the left. A downbow is drawn by first using the upper arm, then the forearm, then the wrist (turning slightly inward) in order to maintain a straight stroke. An upbow is drawn by moving first the forearm, then the upper arm, then the wrist (pushing slightly upward). The bow is mostly used perpendicular to the string being played. In order to perform string changes the whole arm is either lowered or lifted, with as little wrist movement as possible in order to maintain the angle to the string. However, flexibility of the wrist is necessary when changing the bow direction from up-bow to down-bow and vice versa. For very fast bow movements, the wrist is used to accomplish the horizontal movement of bow. For longer strokes, the arm is used as well as the wrist.

Tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors. The three most important ones are: bow speed, weight applied to the string, and point of contact of the bow hair with the string. A good player will be capable of a very even tone, and will counter the natural tendency to play with the most force with the part of the bow nearest to the frog or heel, and the least force near the tip. The closer to the bridge the string is bowed, the more projecting and brighter the tone, with the extreme (sul ponticello) producing a metallic, shimmery sound. If bowing closer to the fingerboard (sul tasto), the sound produced will be softer, more mellow, and less defined.



Double stops involve the playing of two notes at the same time. Two strings are fingered simultaneously, and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once. Triple and quadruple stops may also be played (in a "broken" fashion), but are difficult to sustain because of the change in slope of the bridge. To extend the technique in this area, Frances-Marie Uitti has invented a two-bow system: one bow plays above the strings and one below, allowing for sustained triple and quadruple stops. However, this technique is very rarely seen or used.



In pizzicato playing, the string is plucked directly with the fingers or thumb. Usually this is done with the right hand, while the bow is held away from the strings by the rest of the hand or (for extended passages) set down. A single string can be played pizzicato, or double, triple, or quadruple stops can be played. Occasionally, a player must bow one string with the right hand and simultaneously pluck another with the left. This is marked by a "+" above the note. Strumming of chords is also possible, in guitar fashion.



Col legno is the technique in which the player uses the wood rather than the hair of the bow on the strings; it takes two different forms, col legno battuto and col legno tratto. Col legno battuto is performed as a percussive technique with no sustaining of the sound. The much less common alternative is col legno tratto, wherein the wood is drawn across the string as the hair is in a normal bow stroke. Some players refuse to use this technique because of potential damage to the bow.



In spiccato playing, the strings are not "drawn" by the bow hair but struck by it, while still retaining some horizontal motion, to generate a more percussive, crisp sound. It may be performed by using the wrist to "dip" the bow into the strings. Spiccato is usually associated with lively playing. On a violin, spiccato bowing comes off the string, but on a cello, the wood of the bow may rise briskly up without the hair actually leaving the string. While playing spiccato, the bow is literally bouncing off the string. Cello players simply "dip" the bow into the string, and touch it very fast, and then lift the bow off the string.



In staccato, the player moves the bow a small distance and stops it on the string, making a short sound, the rest of the written duration being taken up by silence.



Legato is a technique where the notes are smoothly connected without accents or breaks.



Sul ponticello "on the bridge" refers to bowing closer to the bridge, while sul tasto "on the fingerboard" calls for bowing nearer the end of the fingerboard. Ponticello calls for more bow weight and slower bow speed, and produces a "harder" sound, with strong overtone content. Sul tasto, in extreme cases called "flautando," produces a more flute-like sound, with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note, and softer overtones.



1/8 size cello with full size cello
Standard-sized cellos are referred to as "full-size". However, cellos come in smaller (fractional) sizes, from "seven-eighths" and "three-quarter" down to "one-sixteenth" sized cellos (e.g. 7/8, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/10, 1/16). The smaller-sized cellos are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply 'scaled-down' for the benefit of children and shorter adults. A "half-size" cello is not actually half the size of a "full-size", but only slightly smaller. Many smaller cellists prefer to play a "seven-eighths" cello as the hand stretches in the lower positions are less demanding. Although rare, cellos in sizes larger than four-fourths do exist. Cellists with unusually large hands may play a slightly larger than full-sized cello. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made after that date, and than those made and commonly played today. Around 1680, string-making technology made lower pitches on shorter strings possible. The cellos of Stradivari, for example, can be clearly divided into two models, with the style made before 1702 characterized by larger instruments (of which only three examples are extant in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1702, when Stradivari, presumably in response to the "new" type of strings, began making cellos of a smaller size. This later model is the one most commonly used by modern luthiers.



There are many accessories for the cello.
*Cases are used to protect the cello and bow (or multiple bows) when traveling and for safe storage. They are often made of carbon fiber, fiber-glass, and less commonly wood.
*Rosin, made from conifer resin, is applied to the bow hairs to increase the effectiveness of the friction, grip or bite, and allow proper sound production.  Rosin may have additives to modify the friction such as beeswax, gold, silver or tin.
*Endpin stops or straps (tradenames include Rockstop and Black Hole) keep the cello from sliding if the end pin does not have a rubber piece on the end (used on wood floors) though in many cases a rubber piece will not suffice on even a wood floor. Many Cellists often use a square or rectangle of carpet that can be secured under the front two legs of the chair as an endpin stop. This is however less likely to be seen in a professional arena and more used in rehearsal or in private.Players might even use their shoe to keep the endpin in place
*Wolf tone eliminators are sometimes placed on cello strings between the tailpiece and the bridge in order to eliminate acoustic anomalies known as wolf tones or "wolfs".
*Mutes are used to change the sound of the cello by reducing overtones. Practice mutes (made of metal) significantly reduce the instrument's volume (they are also referred to as "hotel mutes"). The most common mute is a rubber disc with two holes to fit the two middle strings. It sits just after the bridge and has a flap that can be placed over the top of the bridge to mute the vibrations travelling down it to the sound post inside the cello. These are especially used due to their simplicity and can be taken off or put on very quickly due to the fact that they stay on the strings past the bridge, which don't vibrate.
*Metronomes provide a steady tempo by sounding out a certain number of beats per minute. They are adjustable to fit the tempo of the piece. Many models can also produce a tuning pitch of A4 (440 Hz), among others. These can, of course, be used for all instruments.
*Humidifiers are used to control and stabilize the humidity around and inside the cello and are popular with travelling cellists. Often placed inside the cello itself or inside the case. Some players will not use humidifiers inside their cellos because they have the potential to drip, which may cause damage to the cello
*Tuners are used to tune the instrument. A tuner helps by providing a reference pitch to tune to. Most musicians cannot memorize the exact sound of a pitch, so they need a reference pitch



Cellos are part of the standard symphony orchestra. Usually, the orchestra includes eight to twelve cellists. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The principal, or "first chair" cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, and playing solos. Principal players always sit closest to the audience.

The cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the harmony for the orchestra. On many occasions, the cello section will play the melody for a brief period of time, before returning to the harmony. There are also cello concertos, which are orchestral pieces in which a featured, solo cellist is accompanied by an entire orchestra.



There are numerous cello concertos - where a solo cello is accompanied by an orchestra -  notably 25 by Vivaldi, 12 by Boccherini, 3 by C.P.E. Bach, 2 by Haydn, 2 by Saint-Saëns, 2 by Dvořák, and one each by Schumann, Lalo and Elgar. Beethoven's Triple Concerto for Cello, Violin and Piano and Brahms' Double Concerto for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. The most important are Strauss' tone poem Don Quixote, Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme, Bloch's Schelomo and Bruch's Kol Nidrei.

In the 20th century, the cello repertoire grew. This was due to the influence of virtuoso cellist Mstislav Rostropovich who inspired, commissioned and/or premiered dozens of new works. Among these, Prokofiev's Symphonia Concertante, Britten's Cello Symphony and the concertos of Shostakovich, Lutosławski and Dutilleux have already become part of the standard repertoire. In addition, Hindemith, Barber, Honegger, Villa-Lobos, Myaskovsky, Walton, Glass, Rodrigo, Arnold, Penderecki and Ligeti also wrote major concertos for other cellists (notably Gregor Piatigorsky, Siegfried Palm and Julian Lloyd Webber). 
Cellists Julian Lloyd Webber (left) and Mstislav Rostropovich
There are also many sonatas for cello and piano. Those written by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Brahms, Grieg, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Britten are the most famous.

Finally, there are several unaccompanied pieces for cello, most importantly J.S. Bach's  six Unaccompanied Suites for Cello (arguably the most important cello pieces), Zoltán Kodály's Sonata for Solo Cello and Britten's three Unaccompanied Suites for Cello. Other notable examples include Dutilleux' Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher, Berio's Les Mots Sont Allés (both part of a series of twelve compositions for solo cello commissioned by Rostropovich for Swiss conductor Paul Sacher's 70th birthday), Ligeti and Carter's sonatas and Xenakis' Nomos Alpha and Kottos.



The cello is a member of the traditional string quartet as well as string quintets, sextet or trios and other mixed ensembles. 
There are also pieces written for two, three, four or more cellos; this type of ensemble is also called a "cello choir" and its sound is familiar from the introduction to Rossini's William Tell Overture as well as Zaccharias' prayer scene in Verdi's Nabucco. As a self-sufficient ensemble, its most famous repertoire is Villa-Lobos' first of his Bachianas Brasileiras for cello ensemble (the fifth is for soprano and 8 cellos). Another example is Boulez' Messagesquisse for 7 cellos. The Twelve Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (or "the Twelve" as they have since taken to being called) specialize in this repertoire and have commissioned many works, including arrangements of well-known popular songs.



Though the cello is less common in popular music than in classical music, it is sometimes featured in pop and rock recordings. The cello is rarely part of a group's standard lineup (though like its cousin the violin it is becoming more common in mainstream pop).

In the 1960s, artists such as the Beatles and Cher used the cello in popular music, in songs such as "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)," "Eleanor Rigby" and "Strawberry Fields Forever". In the 1970s, the Electric Light Orchestra enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called "Beatlesque" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, Colosseum II, collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording Variations. Most notably, Pink Floyd included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental Atom Heart Mother. Bass guitarist Mike Rutherford of Genesis was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their Foxtrot album.

Established non-traditional cello groups include Apocalyptica, a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of Metallica songs, Rasputina, a group of two female cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, Von Cello, a cello fronted rock power trio, and Break of Reality who mix elements of classical music with the more modern rock and metal genre. These groups are examples of a style that has become known as cello rock. The crossover string quartet bond also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Vivacello are Russian (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in Siberia.

More recent bands using the cello are Aerosmith, Nirvana, Oasis, Murder by Death, Cursive, and OneRepublic. So-called "chamber pop" artists like Kronos Quartet, The Vitamin String Quartet and Margot and the Nuclear So and So's have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band System of a Down has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band The Stiletto Formal are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound, and the orch-rock group,The Polyphonic Spree, which has pioneered the use of stringed and symphonic instruments, employs the cello in very creative ways for many of their "psycadelic-esque" melodies.

Pop star Richard Marx uses a cello in some of his studio recordings, such as "One Thing Left" and "In This All Alone."

Post-rock bands and other avant-garde groups commonly feature strings; cellos and violins over violas and contrabasses.

Modern musical theatre pieces like Jason Robert Brown's The Last Five Years, Duncan Sheik's Spring Awakening, Adam Guettel's Floyd Collins, and Ricky Ian Gordon's My Life with Albertine use small string ensembles (including solo cellos) to a prominent extent.

The cello can also be used in bluegrass and folk music, with notable players including Ben Sollee of the Sparrow Quartet and the "Cajun cellist" Sean Grissom.

The cello and the double bass are now also used in some modern Chinese orchestras .

In jazz, bassists Oscar Pettiford and Harry Babasin were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; both tuned their instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass.  Fred Katz (who was not a bassist) was one of the first notable jazz cellists to use the instrument's standard tuning and arco technique.  Contemporary jazz cellists include Abdul Wadud, Diedre Murray, Ron Carter, Dave Holland, David Darling, Lucio Amanti, Akua Dixon, Ernst Reijseger, Fred Lonberg-Holm, Vincent Courtois, Jean-Charles Capon, and Erik Friedlander.




Cellos are made by luthiers, specialists in building and repairing stringed instruments, ranging from guitars to violins. The following luthiers are notable for the cellos they have produced:
*Nicolò Amati and others in the Amati family
*William Forster
*Nicolò Gagliano
*Matteo Goffriller
*Giovanni Battista Guadagnini
*Giuseppe Guarneri
*Domenico Montagnana
*Giovanni Battista Rogeri
*Francesco Ruggieri
*Stefano Scarampella
*Antonio Stradivari
*David Tecchler 
*Carlo Giuseppe Testore
*Jean Baptiste Vuillaume




A person who plays the cello is called a cellist, not a "celloist." For a list of notable cellists, see the list of cellists. See also .




Specific instruments are, or become, famous, for a variety of reasons.   An instrument's notability may arise from its age, the fame of its maker, its physical appearance, its acoustic properties, and its use by notable performers.  The most famous instruments are generally known for all of these things.  The most highly prized instruments are now collector's items, and are priced beyond the reach of most musicians.  These instruments are typically owned by some kind of organization or investment group, which loans the instrument to a performer for his or her use.  (For example, the Davidov Stradivarius, which is currently in the possession of one of the most widely-known living cellists, Yo-Yo Ma, is actually owned by the Vuitton Foundation.

Lyre



The  lyre is a stringed musical instrument well known for its use in classical antiquity and later. The recitations of the Ancient Greeks were accompanied by lyre playing. The lyre of Classical Antiquity was ordinarily played by being strummed with a plectrum, like a guitar or a zither, rather than being plucked, like a harp. The fingers of the free hand silenced the unwanted strings in the chord.



Lyres from various times and places are regarded by some organologists (specialists in the history of musical instruments) as a branch of the zither family, a general category which includes many different stringed instruments, such as lutes, guitars, kantele, and psalteries, not just zithers.

Others view the lyre and zither as being two separate classes. Those specialists maintain that the zither is distinguished by strings spread across all or most of its soundboard, or the top surface of its sound chest, also called soundbox or resonator, as opposed to the lyre, whose strings emanate from a more or less common point off the soundboard, such as a tailpiece. Examples of that difference include a piano (a keyed zither) and a violin (referred to by some as a species of fingerboard lyre). Some specialists even argue that instruments such as the violin and guitar belong to a class apart from the lyre because they have no yokes or uprights surmounting their resonators as "true" lyres have. This group they usually refer to as the lute class, after the instrument of that name, and include within it the guitar, the violin, the banjo, and similar stringed instruments with fingerboards. Those who differ with that opinion counter by calling the lute, violin, guitar, banjo, and other such instruments "independent fingerboard lyres," as opposed to simply "fingerboard lyres" such as the Welsh crwth, which have both fingerboards and frameworks above their resonators.

One point on which organologists universally agree is that the distinction between harps on the one hand and zithers and lyres (and, in some views, lutes) on the other is that harps have strings emanating directly from the soundboard and residing in a plane that is basically perpendicular to the soundboard, as opposed to the other instruments, whose strings are attached to one or more points somewhere off the soundboard (e.g., wrest pins on a zither, tailpiece on a lyre or lute) and lie in a plane essentially parallel to it. They also agree that neither the overall size of the instrument nor the number of strings on it have anything to do with its classification. For example, small Scottish and Irish harps can be held on the lap, while some ancient Sumerian lyres appear to have been as tall as a seated man (see Kinsky; also Sachs, History ..., under "References"). Regarding the number of strings, the standard 88-key piano has many more strings than even the largest harp.



Women posing as a Siren with a lyre in 1913.
A classical lyre has a hollow body or sound-chest (also known as soundbox or resonator). Extending from this sound-chest are two raised arms, which are sometimes hollow, and are curved both outward and forward. They are connected near the top by a crossbar or yoke. An additional crossbar, fixed to the sound-chest, forms the bridge which transmits the vibrations of the strings. The deepest note was that farthest from the player's body; as the strings did not differ much in length, more weight may have been gained for the deeper notes by thicker strings, as in the violin and similar modern instruments, or they were tuned by having a  slacker tension. The strings were of gut. They were stretched between the yoke and bridge, or to a tailpiece below the bridge. There were two ways of tuning: one was to fasten the strings to pegs which might be turned; the other was to change the place of the string upon the crossbar; probably both expedients were used simultaneously.
Statue of the  Olympian deity, Apollo holding a lyre.
According to ancient Greek mythology, the young god Hermes created the lyre from a slaughtered cow from Apollo's sacred herd, using the intestines for the strings. Lyres were associated with Apollonian virtues of moderation and equilibrium, contrasting with the Dionysian pipes and aulos, both of which represented ecstasy and celebration.

Locales in southern Europe, western Asia, or north Africa have been proposed as the historic birthplace of the genus. The instrument is still played in north-eastern parts of Africa.

Some of the cultures using and developing the lyre were the Aeolian and Ionian Greek colonies on the coasts of Asia (ancient Asia Minor, modern day Turkey) bordering the Lydian empire. Some mythic masters like Orpheus, Musaeus, and Thamyris were believed to have been born in Thrace, another place of extensive Greek colonization.
The name kissar (kithara) given by the ancient Greeks to Egyptian box instruments reveals the apparent similarities recognized by Greeks themselves. The cultural peak of ancient Egypt, and thus the possible age of the earliest instruments of this type, predates the 5th century classic Greece.
This indicates the possibility that the lyre might have existed in one of Greece's neighboring countries, either Thrace, Lydia, or Egypt, and was introduced into Greece at pre-classic times.



The number of strings on the classical lyre varied at different epochs, and possibly in different localities – four, seven and ten having been favorite numbers. They were used without a fingerboard, no Greek description or representation having ever been met with that can be construed as referring to one. Nor was a bow possible, the flat sound-board being an insuperable impediment. The plectrum, however, was in constant use. It was held in the right hand to set the upper strings in vibration; when not in use, it hung from the instrument by a ribbon. The fingers of the left hand touched the lower strings (presumably to silence those whose notes were not wanted).

There is no evidence as to the stringing of the Greek lyre in the heroic age. Plutarch says that Olympus and Terpander used but three strings to accompany their recitation. As the four strings led to seven and eight by doubling the tetrachord, so the trichord is connected with the hexachord or six-stringed lyre depicted on so many archaic Greek vases. The accuracy of this representation cannot be insisted upon, the vase painters being little mindful of the complete expression of details; yet one may suppose their tendency would be rather to imitate than to invent a number. It was their constant practice to represent the strings as being damped by the fingers of the left hand of the player, after having been struck by the plectrum which he held in the right hand. Before Greek civilization had assumed its historic form, there was likely to have been great freedom and independence of different localities in the matter of lyre stringing, which is corroborated by the antique use of the chromatic (half-tone) and enharmonic (quarter-tone) tunings pointing to an early exuberance, and perhaps also to an Asiatic bias towards refinements of intonation.



While the lyre is no longer played in modern Greece, the term lyra lives on as the name shared by various regional types of fiddles (bowed lutes) found throughout the country. There are two basic styles of lyra fiddles: 1) a pear-shaped instrument with a vaulted back which is found in the Greek islands – in particular, the Dodecanese and Crete – and the northern mainland regions of Macedonia and Thrace; and 2) an instrument with a narrow rectangular cylinder body of the Pontic  Greeks who trace their roots to Pontos (Pontus), the Black Sea region of northern Turkey. (The Pontic Greek lyra is also known as kemenche.) Both types of lyra typically have three strings. They are held vertically upright and bowed horizontally; if the player is seated, the instrument's base rests on the player's upper left thigh. The Cretan lyra is traditionally played in a duo with the laouto, a long-neck fretted lute that is strummed like a guitar.




Reproduction of the lyre from the royal burial at Sutton Hoo, late 6th/early 7th century AD

Other instruments known as lyres have been fashioned and used in Europe outside the Greco-Roman world since at least the early Middle Ages, and one view holds that many modern stringed instruments are late-emerging examples of the lyre class. There is no clear evidence that non-Greco-Roman lyres were played exclusively with plectra, and numerous instruments regarded by some as modern lyres are played with bows.

Lyres appearing to have emerged independently of Greco-Roman prototypes were used by the Teutonic, Gallic, Scandinavian, and Celtic peoples over a thousand years ago. Dates of origin, which probably vary from region to region, cannot be determined, but the oldest known fragments of such instruments are thought to date from around the sixth century of the Common Era. After the bow made its way into Europe from the Middle-East, around two centuries later, it was applied to several species of those lyres that were small enough to make bowing practical. There came to be two broad classes of bowed European yoke lyres: those with fingerboards dividing the open space within the yoke longitudinally, and those without fingerboards. The last surviving examples of instruments within the latter class were the Scandinavian talharpa and jouhikko. Different tones could be obtained from a single bowed string by pressing the fingernails of the player's left hand against various points along the string to fret the string.

The last of the bowed yoke lyres with fingerboard was the "modern" (ca. 1485 - ca. 1800) Welsh crwth. It had several predecessors both in the British Isles and in Continental Europe. Pitch was changed on individual strings by pressing the string firmly against the fingerboard with the fingertips. Like a violin, this method shortened the vibrating length of the string to produce higher tones, while releasing the finger gave the string a greater vibrating length, thereby producing a tone lower in pitch. This is the principle on which the modern violin and guitar work.

While the dates of origin and other evolutionary details of the European bowed yoke lyres continue to be disputed among organologists, there is general agreement that none of them were the ancestors of modern orchestral bowed stringed instruments, as once was thought.



In furniture design, a lyre arm is a wooden lyre-shaped element often used at the front of the arm of a chair, typically created as an exposed wooden part of a chair, sofa or other furniture piece.

A music holder used by marching bands is also called a "lyre" for its shape similar to this instrument.

Lyre also can denote the framework supporting the foot pedals underneath a piano. The term is most often used in connection with older pianos of ornate designs.

The constellation Lyra is said to resemble a lyre shape, but it looks more like a lute.

London



London ( ;  ) is the capital of both England and the United Kingdom, and the largest urban area in the European Union. {{cite web|url= title=Largest EU City   An important settlement for two millennia, London's history goes back to its founding by the Romans.    Since its foundation, London has been part of many movements and phenomena throughout history, including the English Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution, and the Gothic Revival.  The city's core, the ancient City of London, still retains its limited medieval boundaries; but since at least the 19th century, the name "London" has also referred to the whole metropolis that has developed around it.    Today the bulk of this conurbation forms the London region of England    and the Greater London administrative area,    with its own elected mayor and assembly.

London is one of the the world's most important business, financial and cultural centres    and its influence in politics, education, entertainment, media, fashion and the arts contribute to its status as a major global city.       Global Cities: GaWC Inventory of World Cities 1999 Global cities#GaWC Inventory of World Cities (1999 Edition);  Global Cities: GaWC Inventory of World Cities 2004 Global cities#GaWC Leading World Cities (2004 Edition)  Central London is the headquarters of more than half of the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies. The city is a major tourist destination both for domestic and overseas visitors, with annual expenditure by tourists of around £15 billion. London hosted the 1908 and 1948 Summer Olympic Games and will host the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.

Greater London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; the historic settlement of Greenwich; the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; and the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey and St. Margaret's Church.

London's population draws from a wide range of peoples, cultures, and religions, and over 300 languages are spoken within the city.    As of 2006, it had an official population of 7,512,400 within the boundaries of Greater London    and is the most populous municipality in the European Union.    As of 2001, the Greater London Urban Area had a population of 8,278,251    and the metropolitan area is estimated to have a total population of between 12 and 14 million , the largest metropolitan area in the EU. The public transport network, administered by Transport for London, is one of the most extensive in the world, and Heathrow Airport is the busiest airport in the world by international passenger traffic and the air space is the busiest of any city in the world.  International Passenger Traffic, Airports Council International




The etymology of London remains a mystery. The earliest etymological explanation can be attributed to Geoffrey of Monmouth in Historia Regum Britanniae. The name is described as originating from King Lud, who had allegedly taken over the city and named it Kaerlud.    This was slurred into Kaerludein and finally London. Many other theories have been advanced over the centuries, most of them deriving the name from Welsh or British, and occasionally from Anglo-Saxon or even Hebrew.   
Map of London in 1300, showing the medieval boundaries of the City of London
Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium, following the Roman conquest of Britain.    This Londinium lasted for just seventeen years. Around 61, the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed this first London, burning it to the ground.    The next, heavily planned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.

By the 600s, the Anglo-Saxons had created a new settlement called Lundenwic approximately   upstream from the old Roman city, 
around what is now Covent Garden.    It is likely that there was a harbour at the mouth of the River Fleet for fishing and trading, and this trading grew until the city was overcome by the Vikings and forced to relocate the city back to the location of the Roman Londinium to use its walls for protection.    Viking attacks continued to increase around the rest of South East England, until 886 when Alfred the Great recaptured London and made peace with the Danish leader, Guthrum.    The original Saxon city of Lundenwic became Ealdwic ("old city"), a name surviving to the present day as Aldwych, which is in the modern City of Westminster.

In a retaliatory attack, Ethelred's army achieved victory by pulling down London Bridge with the Danish garrison on top, and English control was re-established. Canute took control of the English throne in 1017, controlling the city and country until 1042, when his death resulted in a reversion to Saxon control under his pious stepson Edward the Confessor, who re-founded Westminster Abbey and the adjacent Palace of Westminster.    By this time, London had become the largest and most prosperous city in England, although the official seat of government was still at Winchester.

Following a victory at the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror, the then Duke of Normandy, was crowned King of England in the newly finished Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.    William granted the citizens of London special privileges, while building what is now known as the Tower of London, in the south-east corner of the city, to keep them under control. .   
The Great Exhibition
In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster, the prime royal residence throughout the Middle Ages.       Westminster became the seat of the royal court and government (persisting until the present day), while its distinct neighbour, the City of London, was a centre of trade and commerce and flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. London grew in wealth and population during the Middle Ages. In 1100 its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.    King Edward I issued an edict in 1290, expelling all Jews from England.    Before the edict, there was an increasing population of Jews, whereas after this time, the population of Jews began to drop considerably.  Disaster struck during the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population. Apart from the invasion of London during the Peasants' Revolt in 1381,    London remained relatively untouched by the various civil wars during the Middle Ages, such as the first and second Barons' Wars and the Wars of the Roses.

After the successful defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, political stability in England allowed London to grow further. In 1603, James VI of Scotland came to the throne of England, essentially uniting the two countries. His enactment of harsh anti-Catholic laws made him unpopular, and an assassination attempt was made on 5 November 1605—the well-known Gunpowder Plot.

The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666
Plague caused extensive problems for London in the early 17th century, culminating in the Great Plague in 1665–1666. This was the last major outbreak in England, possibly thanks to the disastrous fire of 1666.  The Great Fire of London broke out in the original City and quickly swept through London's wooden buildings, destroying large swathes of the city.  A first hand narrative of both plague and fire was provided by Sir Samuel Pepys.    Rebuilding took over ten years, largely under direction of a Commission appointed by King Charles II and chaired by Sir Christopher Wren.

Following London's growth in the 18th century, it became the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925.    Rising traffic congestion on city centre roads led to the creation of the world's first metro system — the London Underground — in 1863, driving further expansion and urbanisation.    London's local government system struggled to cope with the rapid growth, especially in providing the city with adequate infrastructure. Between 1855 and 1889, the Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion. It was then replaced by the County of London, overseen by the London County Council, London's first elected city-wide administration.

A London street hit during the Blitz of World War II
The Blitz and other bombing by the German Luftwaffe during World War II killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across London. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area outside the County of London's borders. The expanded area was called Greater London and was administered by the Greater London Council. An eco revival from the 1980s onwards re-established London's position as a pre-eminent international centre. However, as the seat of government and the most important city in the UK, it has been subjected to bouts of terrorism. Provisional Irish Republican Army bombers sought to pressure the government into negotiations over Northern Ireland, frequently disrupting city activities with bomb threats — some of which were carried out — until their 1997 cease-fire.    More recently, a series of coordinated bomb attacks were carried out by Islamic extremist suicide bombers on the public transport network on 7 July 2005—just 24 hours after London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics.




City Hall at night, home of the Greater London Authority



The administration of London is formed of two tiers — a city-wide, strategic tier and a local tier. City-wide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.    The GLA consists of two elected parts; the Mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, who scrutinise the Mayor's decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year. The GLA was set up in 2000 to replace the similar Greater London Council (GLC) which had been abolished in 1986.    The headquarters of the GLA and the Mayor of London is at City Hall; the Mayor is Boris Johnson. The 33 local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.    They are responsible for local services not overseen by the GLA, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection.



London is the home of the Government of the United Kingdom which is located around the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.    Many government departments are located close to Parliament, particularly along Whitehall, including the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street.    The British Parliament is often referred to as the "Mother of Parliaments" (although this sobriquet was first applied to England itself by John Bright)    because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments. There are 74 Members of Parliament (MPs) from London, who correspond to local parliamentary constituencies in the national Parliament by .    Of these 74 MPs, currently 44 are from the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, 8 are Liberal Democrats and one is from the RESPECT party.

London can be geographically defined in a number of ways, although the situation was once even more ambiguous than it is now and open to periodic legal debate.    At London's core is the small, ancient City of London which is commonly known as 'the City' or 'the Square Mile'.    London's metropolitan area grew considerably during the Victorian era and again during the Interwar period, but expansion halted in the 1940s because of World War II and Green Belt legislation, and the area has been largely static since.    The London region of England, also commonly known as Greater London, is the area administered by the Greater London Authority.  The urban sprawl of the conurbation — or Greater London Urban Area — covers a roughly similar area, with a slightly larger population. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.

Map of Central LondonForty percent of Greater London is covered by the London postal district, within which 'LONDON' forms part of the postal address.    The London telephone area code covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are omitted and some places just outside are included. The area within the orbital M25 motorway is sometimes used to define the "London area"    and the Greater London boundary has been aligned to it in places.    Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London.    Informally, the city is split into North, South, East, West and often also Central London.

The Metropolitan Police District, city-wide local government area and London transport area have varied over time, but broadly coincide with the Greater London boundary.    The Romans may have marked the centre of Londinium with the London Stone, still visible on Cannon Street.    The coordinates of the nominal centre of London (traditionally considered to be the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross, near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall) are approximately  . Trafalgar Square has also become a point for celebrations and protests.



Within London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have City status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are the ceremonial counties.    The current area of Greater London was historically part of the counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.    Unlike most capital cities, London's status as the capital of the UK has never been granted or confirmed officially — by statute or in written form. Its position as the capital has formed through constitutional convention, making its position as de facto capital a part of the UK's unwritten constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.    According to the Collins English Dictionary definition (1994) Collins English Dictionary. Collins Education plc.   of 'the seat of government,' London is not the capital of England, as England does not have its own government. However according to the Oxford English Reference dictionary definition  Oxford English Reference Dictionary. Oxford English.  of 'the most important town...' and many other authorities, "HC 501 0304.PDF" (PDF). Parliament Publications. Retrieved on 2008-06-06.   'England' (1994) Collins English Dictionary.

Greater London covers an area of  .  Its primary geographical feature is the Thames, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.    Since the Victorian era it has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.    The threat has increased over time due to a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.    In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2030, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.




London has a temperate marine climate, like much of the British Isles, so the city rarely sees extremely high or low temperatures. Summers are warm with average high temperatures of   and lows of  , however, temperatures could exceed   on many days.   
Winters in London are chilly, but rarely below freezing with daytime temperatures around 2 - 8 °C (36 - 46 °F), while spring has mild days and cool evenings.

London has regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year, with average precipitation of   every year.
Snow is relatively uncommon, particularly because heat from the urban area can make London up to 5 °C (9 °F) hotter than the surrounding areas in winter. Snowfall, however, is usually, but not always, seen up to a few times a year. London is in USDA Hardiness zone 9, and AHS Heat Zone 2.

In the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, London was noted for its dense fogs and smogs. Following the deadly Great Smog of 1952, the Clean Air Act 1956 was passed, leading to the decline of such severe pollution in the capital.




London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names (e.g. Bloomsbury, Knightsbridge, Mayfair, Whitechapel, Fitzrovia). These are either informal designations, or reflect the names of superseded villages, parishes and city wards. Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but often with no modern official boundaries. However, since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.

The City of London is one of the world's three largest financial centres (alongside New York and Tokyo) with a dominant role in several international financial markets, including cross-border bank lending, international bond issuance and trading, foreign-exchange trading,    over-the-counter derivatives, fund management and foreign equities trading.    It also has the world's largest insurance market, the leading exchange for dealing in non-precious metals, the largest spot gold and gold lending markets, the largest ship broking market, and more foreign banks and investment houses than any other centre.  The City has its own governance and boundaries, giving it a status as the only completely autonomous local authority in London.    London's new financial and commercial hub is the Docklands area to the east of the City, dominated by the Canary Wharf complex. Other businesses locate in the City of Westminster, the home of the UK's national government and the well-known Westminster Abbey.

The West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, with locations such as Oxford Street, Leicester Square, Covent Garden and Piccadilly Circus acting as tourist magnets.    The West London area is known for fashionable and expensive residential areas such as Notting Hill, Knightsbridge and Chelsea — where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.    The average price for all properties in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is £894,000 with similar average outlay in most of Central London.

The eastern region of London contains the East End and East London. The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.    The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which is being developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics.




With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was the most populous city in the world until overtaken by New York in 1925. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of World War 2. There were an estimated 7,512,400 official residents in Greater London as of mid-2006.  However, London's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 8,278,251 people in 2001,  while its wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition used.  According to Eurostat, London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union and the second most populous in Europe (or third if Istanbul is included).

The region covers an area of  . The population density is  , more than ten times that of any other British region.    In terms of population, London is the 25th largest city and the 17th largest metropolitan region in the world. It is also ranked 4th in the world in number of billionaires (United States Dollars) residing in the city.    London ranks as one of the most expensive cities in the world, alongside Tokyo and Moscow.




According to 2008 estimates,    51% of these seven million and seven hundred thousand people people are classed as the indigenous White British, White Irish (2.5%) and "Other White" 10%, the majority of whom are other Europeans. 15% of people are of South Asian descent, including Indian (mainly Punjabi, Hindi, Tamil and Gujarati), Pakistani, Bangladeshi (Bengali) and "Other Asian" (mostly Sri Lankan (Tamil) and other Southern Asian ethnicities). 13% of people are Black (around 7% are Black African, 5% as Black Caribbean, 1% as "Other Black"). 5.5% are of mixed race; 1.5% are Chinese; and 1.5% of people belong to another ethnic group. 30% of inhabitants were born outside the European Union. The Irish born, from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, number approximately 250,000 and are the largest group born outside of Britain.

In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300 languages spoken and more than 50 non-indigenous communities which have a population of more than 10,000 in London.    Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that, as of 2006, London's foreign-born population is 2,288,000 (31%), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.    The 2001 census showed that 27.1% of Greater London's population were born outside the UK, and a slightly higher proportion were classed as non-white.

The table to the right shows the 'Country of Birth' of London residents in 2001, the date of the last UK Census. (Top 21).    Note that a portion of the German-born population are likely to be British nationals born to parents serving in the British armed forces in Germany.




Westminster Abbey is one of London's oldest and most important buildings and a World Heritage Site.
The majority of Londoners - 58.2% - identify themselves as Christians.    This is followed by those of no religion (15.8%), Muslims (8.5%), Hindus (4.1%), Jews (2.1%), Sikhs (1.5%), Buddhists (0.8%) and other (0.5%), though 8.7% of people did not answer this question in the 2001 Census.



London has traditionally been dominated by Christianity, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres,    while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.

Important national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey.    The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, which is the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales.    Religious practice is lower in London than any other part of the UK or Western Europe and is around seven times lower than American averages.    Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is very low within the Anglican denomination, although church attendance, particularly at evangelical Anglican churches in London, has started to increase.



The Swaminarayan Hindu Temple in Neasden
London is also home to sizeable Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities. Many Muslims live in Tower Hamlets and Newham; the most important Muslim edifice is London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park.    London's large Hindu community is found in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter of which is home to one of Europe's largest Hindu temples, Neasden Temple.    Sikh communities are located in East and West London, which is also home to the largest Sikh temple in the world, outside India.

The majority of British Jews live in London, with significant Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Hendon, and Edgware in North London.    Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any single Orthodox synagogue in the whole of Europe, overtaking Ilford synagogue (also in London) in 1998.    The community set up the London Jewish Forum in 2007 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.




The City of London is the world's largest financial centre .    It is home to the London Stock Exchange and Lloyds of London.

London is a major centre for international business and commerce and is one of three "command centres" for the world economy (along with New York City and Tokyo).    According to 2005 estimates by the PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm, London has the 6th largest city economy in the world after Tokyo, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Paris.    London generates approximately 20% of the UK's GDP  (or $446 billion in 2005); while the economy of the London metropolitan area — the second largest in Europe — generates approximately 30% of the UK's GDP (or an estimated $669 billion in 2005).

London's success as a service industry and business centre can be attributed to factors such as English being the native and dominant language of business, close relationship with the U.S. and various countries in Asia. Other factors include English law being the most important and most used contract law in international business and the multi-cultural infrastructure.    Government policies such as low taxes, particularly for foreigners (non-UK domiciled residents do not get taxed on their foreign earnings), a business friendly environment, good transport infrastructure and a deregulated economy with little intervention by the government have all contributed to London's economy becoming more service based.  Over 85% (3.2 million) of the employed population of Greater London works in service industries. Another half a million employees resident in Greater London work in manufacturing and construction, almost equally divided between both.

The three tallest skyscrapers as of 2008 in Canary Wharf as viewed from Cabot Square. It is home to such companies as HSBC and Clifford Chance.

London's largest industry remains finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Over 300,000 people are employed in financial services in London. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. Due to New York's tightening of market regulations, London stock exchanges had approximately 20% more initial public offerings in 2006.   
London is home to banks, brokers, insurers and legal and accounting firms. A second, smaller financial district is developing at Canary Wharf to the east of the city which includes the global headquarters of HSBC, Reuters, Barclays and the Magic Circle, which includes Clifford Chance, the largest law firm in the world. London handled 31% of global currency transactions   — an average daily turnover of US$753 billion — with more US dollars traded in London than New York, and more euros traded than in every other city in Europe combined.

More than half of the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies are headquartered in central London. Over 70% of the FTSE 100 are located within London's metropolitan area, and 75% of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.    Along with professional services, media companies are concentrated in London (see Media in London) and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector (after central banking, the most competitive sector).    The BBC is a key employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. Many national newspapers are edited in London, having traditionally been associated with Fleet Street in the city; they are now primarily based around Canary Wharf.

Due to its prominant global role, London is getting hit harder than any other financial centre in the subprime crisis. The City of London estimates that 70,000 jobs in finance will be cut within barely a year.   
Several foreign banks have started to move off employees from London to their national financial centres, notably Dresdner Kleinwort, BNP Paribas and Santander.

Tourism is one of London's prime industries and employs the equivalent of 350,000 full-time workers in London in 2003,    while annual expenditure by tourists is around £15 billion.

London is too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, having accumulated its buildings over a long period of time and drawn on a wide range of influences. It is, however, mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings.    Many grand houses and public buildings (such as the National Gallery) are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, except for a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City. The disused (but soon to be rejuvenated) 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St Pancras and Paddington (at least internally).

The O 2 , one of the largest dome structures in the world.
The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area, high residential densities in inner London and lower densities in the suburbs. In the dense areas, most of the concentration is achieved with medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers such as the notable "Gherkin", Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square are usually found in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. Other notable modern buildings include City Hall in Southwark with its distinctive oval shape,    the British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross, What was formerly the Millennium Dome, located by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now used as an entertainment venue known as The O 2 .

The development of tall buildings has been encouraged in the London Plan, which will lead to the erection of many new skyscrapers over the next decade, particularly in the City of London and Canary Wharf. The 72-storey,   "Shard London Bridge" by London Bridge station, the   Bishopsgate Tower and many other skyscrapers over   are either proposed or approved and could transform the city's skyline. As of July 2008, there are 426 high-rise buildings (between 23 m to 150 m/75 ft to 491 ft) under construction, approved for construction, and proposed for construction in London.

A great many monuments pay homage to people and events in the city. The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of the centre.




The largest parks in the central area of London are the Royal Parks of Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens at the western edge of central London and Regent's Park on the northern edge.    This park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is located near the tourist attraction of Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.       Closer to central London are the smaller Royal Parks of Green Park and St. James's Park.    Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts.

A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the south-east    and Bushy Park and Richmond Park to the south-west,       as well as Victoria Park, East London to the east. Primrose Hill to the north of Regent's Park is a popular spot to view the city skyline. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including the   Hampstead Heath of North London. This incorporates Kenwood House, the former stately home and a popular location in the summer months where classical musical concerts are held by the lake, attracting thousands of people every weekend to enjoy the music, scenery and fireworks.



Traditionally the London accent has been given the famous Cockney label, and was similar to many accents of the South East of England, developing a unique form of slang known as Cockney Rhyming Slang. The accent of a 21st century Londoner varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under 30s however is some fusion of Cockney, Received Pronunciation, and a whole array of 'ethnic' accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled Multicultural London English (MLE), with a large amount of slang in use as well.




Piccadilly Circus at night
The Trooping the Colour held in 2006 to mark the Queen's 80th birthday.
Within the City of Westminster, the entertainment district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square, where London and world film premieres are held, and Piccadilly Circus, with its giant electronic advertisements.    London's theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs and restaurants, including the city's Chinatown district, and just to the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. The United Kingdom's Royal Ballet,English National Ballet, Royal Opera and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, The London Coliseum, Sadler's Wells Theatre and the Royal Albert Hall as well as touring the country.    Islington's   long Upper Street, extending Northwards from The Angel, has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the UK.    Europe's busiest shopping area is Oxford Street, a shopping street nearly   long — which makes it the longest shopping street in the world — and home to many shops and department stores including Selfridges.    Knightsbridge — home to the Harrods department store — lies just to the southwest. London is home to designers Vivienne Westwood, Galliano, Stella McCartney, Manolo Blahnik, and Jimmy Choo among others; its renowned art and fashion schools make it an international centre of fashion alongside Paris, Milan and New York.

London offers a great variety of cuisine as a result of its ethnically diverse population. Gastronomic centres include the Bangladeshi restaurants of Brick Lane and the Chinese food restaurants of Chinatown.

There are a variety of regular annual events in the city. The beginning of the year is celebrated with the relatively new New Year's Day Parade, while traditional parades include November's Lord Mayor's Show, a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the City, and June's Trooping the Colour, a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen's Official Birthday.




Charles Dickens (1812–1870), whose works formed a pervasive image of Victorian London.

London has been the setting for many works of literature. Two writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire, and Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London.    The earlier (1722) A Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.  William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based in London, and some of his work — most notably his play The Alchemist — was set in the city.  Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are the afore-mentioned Dickens novels, and Arthur Conan Doyle's illustrious Sherlock Holmes stories.  A modern writer pervasively influenced by the city is Peter Ackroyd, in works such as London: The Biography, The Lambs of London and Hawksmoor.

London has played a significant role in the film industry, and has major studios at Pinewood, Ealing, Shepperton, Elstree and Leavesden, as well as an important special effects and post-production community centred in Soho in central London. Working Title Films has its headquarters in London.    The city also hosts a number of performing arts schools, including The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), the Central School of Speech and Drama (alumni: Judi Dench and Laurence Olivier) and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (alumni: Jim Broadbent). The London Film Festival is held each year in October.



London is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions which are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The Natural History Museum (biology and geology), Science Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum (fashion and design) are clustered in South Kensington's "museum quarter", while the British Museum houses historic artefacts from around the world.    The British Library at St Pancras is the UK's national library, housing 150 million items. The city also houses extensive art collections, primarily in the National Gallery,    Tate Britain    and Tate Modern.



The Royal Albert Hall hosts a wide range of concerts and musical events.

London is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and is home to major music corporations, such as EMI and Decca Records, as well as countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. London is home to many orchestras and concert halls such as the Barbican Arts Centre (principal base of the London Symphony Orchestra), Cadogan Hall (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) and the Royal Albert Hall (BBC Promenade Concerts).  London's two main opera houses are the Royal Opera House and the Coliseum Theatre.

Several conservatoires are located within the city: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and Trinity College of Music.

London has numerous renowned venues for rock and pop concerts, including large arenas such as Earls Court, Wembley Arena and the O2 Arena, as well as numerous mid-size venues, such as Brixton Academy, Hammersmith Apollo and The London Astoria.  London also hosts many music festivals, including the 02 Wireless Festival and Latitude Festival.

London is home to the first and original Hard Rock Cafe and the illustrious Abbey Road Studios where The Beatles created many of their hits. Musicians such as Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix and Freddie Mercury have lived in London. A large number of musical artists originate from or are most strongly associated with London, including David Bowie, Ian Dury, The Kinks, Adam Faith, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Madness, The Jam, Blur, Iron Maiden, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Elvis Costello, Dusty Springfield, The Yardbirds and The Small Faces.        
  London was instrumental in the development of punk music,  with figures such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash,  and Vivienne Westwood all based in the city.

More recent artists to emerge from the London music scene include The Libertines, one of the most influential British rock acts of the 2000s,    Bloc Party, Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, The Kooks, Razorlight, Laura Marling, Dizzee Rascal, Natasha Bedingfield and Leona Lewis.

London is also a centre for Urban music. In particular the genres UK Garage, Drum and Bass and Grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of hiphop and reggae, alongside local rave music. Black music station BBC 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of homegrown urban music both in London and the rest of the UK.




Wembley Stadium is home to English football and is the most expensive stadium in the world.   
The Wimbledon Championships, a tennis Grand Slam tournament.

London has hosted the Summer Olympics twice, in 1908 and 1948.       In July 2005 London was chosen to host the Games in 2012, which will make it the first city in the world to host the Summer Olympics three times.    London was also the host of the British Empire Games in 1934.

London's most popular sport (for both participants and spectators) is football. London has thirteen League football clubs, including five in the Premier League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United.    London also has four rugby union teams in the Guinness Premiership (London Irish, Saracens, Wasps and Harlequins), although only the Harlequins play in London (all the other three now play outside Greater London, although Saracens still play within the M25).    There are two professional rugby league clubs in London - Harlequins Rugby League who play in the Super League at the Stoop and the National League 2 side the London Skolars (based in Haringey).

Since 1924, the original Wembley Stadium was the home of the English national football team, and served as the venue for the FA Cup final as well as rugby league's Challenge Cup final.    The new Wembley Stadium serves exactly the same purposes and has a capacity of 90,000.    Twickenham Stadium in west London is the national rugby union stadium, and has a capacity of 84,000 now that the new south stand has been completed.

Cricket in London centres on its two Test cricket grounds at Lord's (home of Middlesex C.C.C) in St John's Wood,    and The Oval (home of Surrey C.C.C) in Kennington.    One of London's best-known annual sports competitions is the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, held at the All England Club in the south-western suburb of Wimbledon.    Other key events are the annual mass-participation London Marathon which sees some 35,000 runners attempt a   course around the city,    and the Oxford vs. Cambridge Boat Race on the River Thames between Putney and Mortlake.




Transport is one of the four areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,    however the mayor's financial control is limited and he does not control the heavy rail network, although in November 2007 he assumed responsibility for the North London Railway as well as several other lines, to form London Overground.    The public transport network, administered by Transport for London (TfL), is one of the most extensive in the world, but faces congestion and reliability issues, which a large investment programme is attempting to address, including £7 billion (€10 billion) of improvements planned for the Olympics.    London has been commended as the city with the best public transport.    Cycling is an increasingly popular way to get around London. The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better provision.



The London Underground is the oldest, longest, and most expansive metro system in the world, dating from 1863.

The centrepiece of the public transport network is the London Underground — commonly referred to as The Tube — which has eleven interconnecting lines. It is the oldest, longest, and most expansive metro system in the world, dating from 1863.   The system was home to the world's first underground electric line, the City & South London Railway, which began service in 1890.    Over three million journeys a day are made on the Underground network, nearly 1 billion journeys each year.    The Underground serves the central area and most suburbs to the north of the Thames, while those to the south are served by an extensive suburban rail surface network.

The Docklands Light Railway is a second metro system using smaller and lighter trains, which opened in 1987, serving East London and Greenwich on both sides of the Thames. Commuter and intercity railways generally do not cross the city, instead running into fourteen terminal stations scattered around its historic centre; the exception is the Thameslink route operated by First Capital Connect, with terminus stations at Bedford, Brighton and Moorgate.    Since the early 1990s, increasing pressures on the commuter rail and Underground networks have led to increasing demands — particularly from businesses and the City of London Corporation — for Crossrail: a £10 billion east – west heavy rail connection under central London, which was given the green light in early October 2007.

High-speed Eurostar trains link St Pancras International with Lille and Paris in France, and Brussels in Belgium. Journey times to Paris and Brussels of 2h 15 and 1h 51 respectively make London closer to continental Europe than the rest of Britain by virtue of the newly completed High Speed 1 rail link to the Channel Tunnel.    From 2009 this line will also allow for high speed domestic travel from Kent into London. The redevelopment of St. Pancras was key to London's Olympic bid, as the station also serves two international airports through Thameslink, and will also provide direct rail links to the Olympic site at Stratford using British Rail Class 395 trains running under the Olympic Javelin name; these will be based on Japanese Shinkansen high-speed trains.



The modern Enviro400 double-decker bus
London's bus network is one of the largest in the world, running 24 hours a day, with 8,000 buses, 700 bus routes, and over 6 million passenger journeys made every weekday. In 2003, the network's ridership was estimated at over 1.5 billion passenger trips per annum, more than the Underground.    Around £850 m is taken in revenue each year.

London has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the world    and, from the 3rd quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced. The distinctive red double-decker buses are internationally recognised, and are a trademark of London transport along with black cabs and the Tube.



Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport, which is the world's busiest airport by international passenger traffic.
London is a major international air transport hub with the largest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the words London Airport in their name, but most traffic passes through one of five major airports. London Heathrow Airport is the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.    In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened,    and plans are already being considered for a sixth terminal.    Similar traffic, with the addition of some low-cost short-haul flights, is also handled at London Gatwick Airport.    London Stansted Airport and London Luton Airport cater mostly for low-cost short-haul flights.       London City Airport, the smallest and most central airport, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.



Although the majority of journeys involving central London are made by public transport, travel in outer London is car-dominated. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes — but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. The M25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at   long.    A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the Ringways Plan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £8 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of congested central London.       Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a vastly reduced season pass which is renewed monthly and is cheaper than a corresponding bus fare.




Royal Holloway, as a part of the University of London, a federation of London higher education institutions
Home to a range of universities, colleges and schools, London has a student population of about 378,000 and is a centre of research and development. Most primary and secondary schools in London follow the same system as the rest of England — comprehensive schooling.

With 125,000 students, the University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the United Kingdom and in Europe.    It comprises 20 colleges as well as several smaller institutes each with a high degree of autonomy. Constituent colleges have their own admissions procedures, and are effectively universities in their own right, although most degrees are awarded by the University of London rather than the individual colleges. Its constituents include multi-disciplinary colleges such as UCL,    King's, Goldsmiths, Queen Mary    and more specialised institutions such as the London School of Economics,    SOAS,    the Royal Academy of Music,    the Courtauld Institute of Art and the Institute of Education.

Imperial College London and University College London have been ranked among the top ten universities in the world by The Times Higher Education Supplement: in 2008 Imperial was ranked the 6th best and UCL the 7th best university in the world.

In addition, the London School of Economics is the world‘s leading social science institution for teaching and research, plus has the most international student body of any university in the world today.

A number of colleges are dedicated to the fine arts, including the Royal College of Music, Royal College of Art, and Guildhall School of Music and Drama.

Senate House, the headquarters of the federal University of London
London's other universities, such as Brunel University, City University, London Metropolitan University, Middlesex University, University of East London, University of the Arts London, University of Westminster, Kingston University and London South Bank University are not part of the University of London but are still leaders in their field and popular choices among students both nationally and internationally. Some were polytechnics until these were granted university status in 1992, and others which were founded much earlier. Imperial College London left the federal University of London in 2007. Since the merger of University of North London and London Guildhall University in 2003, London Metropolitan University is the largest unitary university in the capital, with over 34,000 students from 155 countries.  About London Met London Metropolitan University, August 2008  London is also known globally for its business education, with the London Business School (ranked 1st in Europe — Business Week)    and Cass Business School (Europe's largest finance school) both being top world-rated business schools.    In addition there are three international universities: Schiller International University, Richmond University and Regent's College.

Beijing



(  or   in English; Chinese:  ; pinyin: Běijīng;  ; Wade-Giles: Peiching or Pei-ching) (also formerly known in English as Peking (   or  )) is a metropolis in northern China and the capital of the People's Republic of China. It is one of the four municipalities of the PRC, which are equivalent to provinces in China's administrative structure.  The municipality of Beijing borders Hebei Province to the north, west, south, and for a small section in the east, and Tianjin Municipality to the southeast.     Beijing is one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China.

Beijing is China's second largest city, after Shanghai.  Beijing is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and motorways passing through the city. It is also the focal point of many international flights to China. Beijing is recognised as the political, educational, and cultural center of the People's Republic of China,    while Shanghai and Hong Kong predominate in economic fields.           The city hosted the 2008 Olympic Games.

Few cities in the world besides Beijing have served as the political and cultural centre of an area as immense as China for so long.    The Encyclopædia Britannica describes it as, "One of the world's great cities,"    and declares that the city has been an integral part of China’s history for centuries, and there is scarcely a major building of any age in Beijing that doesn't have at least some national historical significance.  Beijing is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, and huge stone walls and gates.    Its art treasures and universities have long made the city a centre of culture and art in China.



Beijing or Peking ( ) means "northern capital", in line with the common East Asian tradition whereby capital cities are explicitly named as such. Other cities that are similarly named include Nanjing ( ), China, meaning "southern capital"; Tokyo ( ), Japan, and Đông Kinh ( , now Hanoi), Vietnam, both meaning "eastern capital"; as well as Kyoto ( ), Japan, and ( ; now Seoul), Korea, both meaning simply "capital".

Peking is the name of the city according to Chinese Postal Map Romanization, and the traditional customary name for Beijing in English (passports issued by the British Embassy are still printed as being issued by the "British Embassy, Peking"). The term Peking originated with French missionaries four hundred years ago and corresponds to an older pronunciation predating a subsequent sound change in Mandarin from   to   Coblin, W. South. "A Brief History of Mandarin." Journal of the American Oriental Society 120, no. 4 (2000): 537-52.  (  is represented in pinyin as j, as in Beijing). It is still used in many languages.

The pronunciation "Peking" is also closer to the Fujianese dialect of Amoy or Min Nan spoken in the city of Xiamen, a port where European traders first landed in the 16th century, while "Beijing" more closely approximates the Mandarin dialect's pronunciation. 1997 CNN interview with the last British colonial governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten

The city has been renamed several times. During the Jin Dynasty, the city was known as Zhongdu ( ) , and then later under the Mongol Yuan Dynasty as Dadu ( ) in Chinese    and Daidu to Mongols Denis Twitchett, Herbert Franke, John K. Fairbank, in The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), p 454.  (also recorded as Cambuluc    by Marco Polo). Twice in the city's history, the name was changed from Beijing (Peking) to Beiping (Peiping) (  Pinyin: Beiping; Wade-Giles: Pei-p'ing), literally "Northern Peace". This occurred first under the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, and again in 1928 with the Kuomintang (KMT) government of the Republic of China.  On each occasion, the name change removed the element meaning "capital" (jing or king,  ) to reflect the fact the national capital had changed to Nanjing. The city's name was also twice changed from Beiping (Peiping) to Beijing (Peking). This occurred first under the Yongle Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, who moved the capital from Nanjing back to Beijing, and again in 1949, when the Communist Party of China restored Beijing as China's capital after the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Yanjing ( ; Pinyin: Yānjīng; Wade-Giles: Yen-ching) is and has been another popular informal name for Beijing, a reference to the ancient State of Yan that existed here during the Zhou Dynasty. This name is reflected in the locally brewed Yanjing Beer as well as Yenching University, an institution of higher learning that was merged into Peking University.

: The history section below outlines other historical names of Beijing.



Zhoukoudian
The earliest remnants of human habitation in the Beijing municipality are found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where the Peking Man lived. Homo erectus fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic homo sapiens also lived there about 27,000 years ago.    There were cities in the vicinities of Beijing by the 1st millennium BC, and the capital of the State of Yan, one of the powers of the Warring States Period (473-221 BC), Ji (薊/蓟), was established in present-day Beijing.

After the fall of the Yan, the subsequent Qin, Han, and Jin dynasties set up local prefectures in the area.  In Tang Dynasty it became the headquarters for Fanyang jiedushi, the virtual military governor of current northern Hebei area. The An Shi Rebellion was also launched from here in 755 AD.



The Pagoda of Tianning Temple, at 13 stories and 57.8 m (189 ft) in height, built in 1120 during the Liao Dynasty

In 936, the Later Jin Dynasty (936-947) of northern China ceded a large part of its northern frontier, including modern Beijing, to the Khitan Liao Dynasty. In 938, the Liao Dynasty set up a secondary capital in what is now Beijing, and called it Nanjing (the "Southern Capital"). In 1125, the Jurchen Jin Dynasty conquered Liao, and in 1153 moved its capital to Liao's Nanjing, calling it Zhongdu (中都), the "central capital."  Zhongdu was situated in what is now the area centered around Tianningsi, slightly to the southwest of central Beijing. Some of the oldest existing relics in Beijing, such as the Tianning Temple, date to the Liao era.

Mongol forces burned Zhongdu to the ground in 1215.    Later in 1264, in preparation for the conquest of all of China to establish the Yuan Dynasty, Kublai Khan decided to rebuild it slightly north to the center of the Jin capital, Brian Hook, Beijing and Tianjin: Towards a Millennial Megalopolis, p 2  and in 1272, he made this city his capital as Dadu (大都, Chinese for "great capital"),  or Daidu to the Mongols, otherwise spelled as Cambaluc or Cambuluc in Marco Polo's accounts. Construction of Dadu finished in 1293.  The decision of Kublai Khan greatly enhanced the status of a city that had been situated on the northern fringe of China proper. The center of Dadu was situated slightly north of modern central Beijing. It centered on what is now the northern stretch of the 2nd Ring Road, and stretched northwards to between the 3rd and 4th Ring Roads. There are remnants of the Yuan-era wall still standing, and they are known as the Tucheng (土城 literally, the 'earth wall').



In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming Dynasty and future Hongwu Emperor, made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan capital. The last Yuan emperor fled north to Shangdu and Zhu declared the founding of the Ming Dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in Dadu to the ground. Ebrey, Patricia Buckley. The Cambridge Illustrated History of China. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999.

In 1403, the new (and third) Ming emperor - the Yongle Emperor - renamed this city to Beijing (北京), or "northern capital",  and designated Beijing to be the co-capital alongside the (then) current capital of Nanjing. Beijing was the subject of a major construction project for a new Imperial residence, the Forbidden City that lasted nearly 15 years (1406 to 1420).  When the palace was finished, the Yongle Emperor ceremoniously took up residence. From 1421 onwards, Beijing, also known as Jingshi (京师),  was the "official" capital of the Ming Dynasty while Nanjing was demoted to the status of "secondary" capital. This system of dual capitals (with Beijing being vastly more important) continued for the duration of the Ming Dynasty. Thirteen of the sixteen Ming Emperors are buried in elaborate tombs near Beijing.

By the 15th century, Beijing had essentially taken its current shape, and the Ming-era city wall served as the Beijing city wall until modern times, when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place.    It is believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world from 1425 to 1650 and from 1710 to 1825.    Other notable buildings constructed during the Ming period include the Temple of Heaven (built by 1420).    The Tiananmen Gate, now a state symbol of the People's Republic of China and featured on its emblem, was first built in 1420, and rebuilt several times later. Tiananmen Square was built in 1651 and enlarged in 1958.    Jesuits finished building the first Beijing-area Roman Catholic church in 1652 at the Xuanwu Gate, where Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci lived; the modern Nantang (南堂, Southern Cathedral) has been built over the original cathedral.

The end of the Ming came in 1644 when, for 40 days, Li Zicheng's peasant army captured Beijing and overthrew the Ming government. When the powerful Manchu army arrived at the outskirts of the city, Li and his followers abandoned the city and as a result the Manchu forces, under Prince Dorgon, captured Beijing without a fight.

Prince Dorgon established the Qing Dynasty as a direct successor to the Ming, and Beijing remained China's capital.    The Qing Emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence, but in large part, the Ming buildings and the general layout remained unchanged. Beijing at this time was also known as Jingshi, which corresponded to the Manchu Gemun Hecen with the same meaning.    The classic Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber is set in Beijing during the early years of Qing rule (the end of the 1600s).

At the end of Qing period, Beijing was the scene of the siege of the foreign legations during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.    Some important Imperial structures in the city were destroyed during the fighting, including the Hanlin Academy and the Summer Palace.



The Xinhai Revolution of 1911, aimed at replacing Qing rule with a republic, originally intended to establish its capital at Nanjing. After high-ranking Qing official Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the Qing emperor in Beijing and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries in Nanjing accepted that Yuan should be the president of the new Republic of China, and that the capital should remain at Beijing. Yuan gradually consolidated power and became by 1915 the new emperor but died less than a year into his reign.    China then fell under the control of regional warlords, and the most powerful factions fought frequent wars (the Zhili-Anhui War, the First Zhili-Fengtian War, and the Second Zhili-Fengtian War) to take control of the capital at Beijing.
Following the success of the Kuomintang (KMT)'s Northern Expedition, which pacified the warlords of the north, Nanjing was officially made the capital of the Republic of China in 1928, and Beijing was renamed Beiping (Peip'ing) (北平) on 28 June that year,    in English meaning "northern peace" or "north pacified".  During the Second Sino-Japanese War,  Beiping fell to Japan on 29 July 1937,    and was made the seat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state that ruled the ethnic Chinese portions of Japanese-occupied northern China;    the government was later merged into the larger Wang Jingwei Government based in Nanjing.

On 31 January 1949, during the Chinese Civil War, Communist forces entered Beiping without a fight. On 1 October of the same year, the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, announced in Tiananmen the creation of the People's Republic of China and renamed the city back to Beijing.    Just a few days earlier, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference had decided that Beijing would be the capital of the new government.

At the time of the founding of the People's Republic, Beijing Municipality consisted of just its urban area and immediate suburbs. The urban area was divided into many small districts inside what is now the 2nd Ring Road. The Beijing city wall was torn down to make way for the construction of the 2nd Ring Road, which was finished by 1981 in accord with the 1982 city plan. That road was the first of a series of new ring roads intended for automobiles rather than for bicycles.

Following the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly. Formerly within the confines of the 2nd Ring Road and the 3rd Ring Road, the urban area of Beijing is now pushing at the limits of the recently constructed 5th Ring Road and 6th Ring Road, with many areas that were formerly farmland now developed residential or commercial districts.    According to a 2005 newspaper report, the size of the newly developed Beijing land was one and a half times larger than the land of old Beijing within the 2nd Ring Road.    Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts,    while Zhongguancun has become a major centre of electronics in China.    In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic, poor air quality, the loss of historic neighbourhoods, and significant influx of migrants from various regions of the country, especially rural areas.

On 13 July 2001, the International Olympic Committee selected Beijing as the host for the 2008 Summer Olympics.




Beihai Park, an extensive imperial garden in the center of Beijing 
The Beijing Botanical Garden
Beijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially Yanqing County and Huairou District, are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part of the municipality is framed by the Xishan Mountains. The Great Wall of China, which stretches across the northern part of Beijing Municipality, made use of this rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling in the Xishan ranges and on the border with Hebei is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of 2303 m. Major rivers flowing through the municipality include the Yongding River and the Chaobai River, part of the Hai River system, and flow in a southerly direction. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal of China which was built across the North China Plain to Hangzhou. Miyun Reservoir, built on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is Beijing's largest reservoir, and crucial to its water supply.

The urban area of Beijing is situated in the south-central part of the municipality and occupies a small but expanding part of the municipality's area. It spreads out in bands of concentric ring roads, of which the fifth and outermost, the Sixth Ring Road (the numbering starts at 2), passes through several satellite towns. Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace) and Tian'anmen Square are at the centre of Beijing, and are directly to the south of the Forbidden City, former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, residence of the paramount leaders of the People's Republic of China. Running through central Beijing from east to west is Chang'an Avenue, one of Beijing's main thoroughfares.

The city's climate is a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Koppen climate classification Dwa), characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone.  Average temperatures in January are at around 1 °C (33°F), while average temperatures in July are around 30°C (87 °F). The highest temperature ever recorded was 42 °C and the lowest recorded was -27 °C.    In 2005, the total precipitation was 410.77 mm; the majority of it occurred in the summer.



Air pollution levels on an average day in Beijing are nearly five times above World Health Organization standards for safety.    Joint research between United States and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that a lot of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. According to the research, 34% of PM 2.5  and on average 35-60% of ozone can be traced to sources outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a "significant influence on Beijing's air quality." David G. Streetsa, Joshua S. Fub, Carey J. Jangc, Jiming Haod, Kebin Hed,

Heavy air pollution has resulted in widespread smog.  This photo, taken in August 2005, shows the contrasting air quality in Beijing in days of difference
In preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and after promising to cleanup the city's air, nearly US$17 billion was spent to clean the air, and Beijing had implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the games. This included stopping work on all construction sites, closing many factories both in and around Beijing, closing some gas stations,    and cutting motor traffic by half.    Two new subway lines were opened and thousands of old taxis and buses were replaced to encourage residents to use public transport. The Beijing government encouraged a discussion to keep the odd-even scheme in place after the Olympics,    and although the scheme was eventually lifted on 21 September 2008, it was replaced by new restrictions on government vehicles    and a new restriction making car owners use public transport once a week based on their license plate, coming into force in October.  Post-Olympics Beijing car restrictions to take effect next month  In addition to the vehicle restrictions, staggered office hours and retail opening times have been encouraged to avoid the rush hour, parking fees increased, and 357,000 "yellow label" vehicles — those that have too high emission levels — will be banned in Beijing altogether from January.

According to the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), China has spent 17 billion  over the last three years on a large scale green drive. Beijing has added 3,800 natural gas buses, the largest fleet in the world. Twenty percent of the Olympic venues' electricity comes from renewable energy sources. Muqbil, IMTIAZ, Golden effort maligned,Bangkok Post, 8/17/2008, from  accessed 8/21/2008   The city has also planted hundreds of thousands of trees and increased green space in an effort to make the city more livable.



Dust from erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects.    In the first four months of 2006 alone, there were no fewer than eight such storms.    In April 2002, one dust storm alone dumped nearly 50,000 tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and Korea.

Major neighbourhoods in urban Beijing include the following. Neighbourhoods may overlap across multiple districts (see below):

Several place names in Beijing end with mén ( ), meaning "gate", as they were the locations of gates in the former Beijing city wall. Other place names end in cūn ( ), meaning "village", as they were originally villages outside the city wall.

Beijing's 18 districts and counties are further subdivided into 273 lower (third)-level administrative units at the township level: 119 towns, 24 townships, 5 ethnic townships and 125 subdistricts.



Inside the Forbidden City 
Three styles of architecture predominate in urban Beijing. First, the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. Next there is what is sometimes referred to as the "Sino-Sov" style, built between the 1950s and the 1970s, with structures tending to be boxy, bland, and poorly made.    Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms — most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD and Beijing Financial Street.

Beijing of the early 21st century has witness tremendous growth of new building constructions, showing various modern styles from international designers. A mixture of both old and new styles of architecture can be seen at the 798 Art Zone, which mixes 1950s design with a blend of the new.




Municipal government is regulated by the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in issuing administrative orders, collecting taxes, and operating the economy. The local party authority is headed by the Beijing CPC Secretary (北京市委书记). The local CCP also directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing local government. Local government figures include a mayor, vice-mayor, and numerous bureaus focusing on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as the capital of China, Beijing houses all the important national governmental and political institutions, including the National People's Congress.

Beijing is amongst the most developed cities in China with tertiary industry accounting for 71.3% of its GDP, making it the first post industrial city in mainland China.     Financial industry is one of the most important industries of Beijing.    By the end of 2007, there are 751 financial organizations in Beijing that generated 128.6 billion RMB revenue accounting for 11.6% of the total financial industry revenue of the entire country. It is also accounts for 13.8% of Beijing's GDP, the highest percentage of that of all Chinese cities.

In 2007, Beijing's nominal GDP was 900.62 billion RMB (118.4 billion USD), a year-on-year growth of 12.3% from the previous year. Its GDP per capita was 56,044 RMB, an increase of 8.9% from the previous year. In 2007, Beijing's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 10.13 billion RMB, 247.93 billion RMB, and 642.56 billion RMB. In 2007, Urban disposable income per capita was 21,989 yuan, a real increase of 11.2% from the previous year. Per capita pure income of rural residents was 9,559 RMB, a real increase of 8.2%.    Per capita disposable income of the 20% low-income residents increased 16.7%, 11.4 percentage points higher than the growth rate of the 20% high-income residents. The Engel's coefficient of Beijing's urban residents reached 31.8% in 2005 and that of the rural residents was 32.8%, declining 4.5 percentage points and 3.9 percentage points, respectively, compared with 2000.

Beijing's real estate and automobile sectors have continued to boom in recent years. In 2005, a total of 28.032 million square metres of housing real estate was sold, for a total of 175.88 billion RMB. The total number of cars registered in Beijing in 2004 was 2,146,000, of which 1,540,000 were privately owned (a year-on-year increase of 18.7%).

The Beijing CBD, centred at the Guomao area, has been identified as the city's new central business district, and is home to a variety of corporate regional headquarters, shopping precincts, and high-end housing. The Beijing Financial Street, in the Fuxingmen and Fuchengmen area, is a traditional financial centre. The Wangfujing and Xidan areas are major shopping districts. Zhongguancun, dubbed "China's Silicon Valley", continues to be a major centre in electronics- and computer-related industries, as well as pharmaceuticals-related research. Meanwhile, Yizhuang, located to the southeast of the urban area, is becoming a new centre in pharmaceuticals, IT, and materials engineering.    Urban Beijing is also known for being a centre of pirated goods and anything from the latest designer clothing to the latest DVDs can be found in markets all over the city, often marketed to expatriates and international visitors.

Major industrial areas include Shijingshan, located on the western outskirts of the city.     Agriculture is carried out outside the urban area of Beijing, with wheat and maize (corn) being the main crops.  Vegetables are also grown in the regions closer to the urban area in order to supply the city.

Beijing is increasingly becoming known for its innovative entrepreneurs and high-growth start-ups. This culture is backed by a large community of both Chinese and foreign venture capital firms, such as Sequoia Capital, whose head office in China resides in Chaoyang, Beijing. Though Shanghai is seen as the economic centre of China, this is typically based on the numerous large corporations based there, rather than as a centre for Chinese entrepreneurship.

The development of Beijing continues to proceed at a rapid pace, and the vast expansion of Beijing has created a multitude of problems for the city. Beijing is known for its smog as well as the frequent "power-saving" programmes instituted by the government. Citizens of Beijing as well as tourists frequently complain about the quality of the water supply and the cost of the basic services such as electricity and natural gas. To reduce air pollution, a number of major industries have been ordered to reduce emissions or leave the city.  Beijing Capital Steel, once one of the city's largest employers and its single biggest polluter, has been moving most of its operations to Tangshan.  &

Specially designated industrial parks in Beijing include: Zhongguancun Science Park, Yongle Economic Development Zone,  Beijing Economic-technological Development Area, and Tianzhu Airport Industrial Zone.

The population of Beijing Municipality, defined as the total number of people who reside in Beijing for 6 months or more per year, was 17.4 million at the end of 2007. There were 12.04 million people in Beijing Municipality who had Beijing hukou (permanent residence), and the remainder were on temporary residence permits.        /ref>   /ref> In 2006, a study by the Beijing Statistics Bureau estimated the total of all people living in Beijing (permanent, temporary, unregistered and others) to be "close to 20 million."    
Recent statistics cited by China Daily put the number of migrant workers in the service and construction industries in Beijing at "more than 5.1 million."  /ref>  In addition, there is a large number of migrant workers ( min gong) who live illegally in Beijing without any official residence permit (or unregistered people).

The population of Beijing's urban core (city proper) is around 7.7 million. After Chongqing and Shanghai, Beijing is the third largest of the four municipalities of the PRC, which are equivalent to provinces in China's administrative structure.

Most of Beijing's residents belong to the Han Chinese majority. Other ethnic minorities include the Manchu, Hui, and Mongol.    A Tibetan-language high school exists for youth of Tibetan ancestry, nearly all of whom have come to Beijing from Tibet expressly for their studies.    A sizable international community exists in Beijing, many attracted by the highly growing foreign business and trade sector, others by the traditional and modern culture of the city. Much of this international community lives in the areas around the Beijing CBD, Sanlitun, and Wudaokou. In recent years there has also been an influx of South Koreans who live in Beijing predominantly for business and study purpose. Many of them live in the Wangjing and Wudaokou areas.

People native to urban Beijing speak the Beijing dialect, which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of spoken Chinese. Beijing dialect is the basis for Standard Mandarin, the language used in mainland China,  Taiwan, and Singapore. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have their own dialects akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.

Beijing opera, or Peking opera (Jingju 京剧), is well-known throughout the national capital. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of Chinese culture, Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences, such as gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from modern Standard Mandarin and from the Beijing dialect.

Siheyuans line hutongs ( ), or alleys, which connect the interior of Beijing's old city. They are usually straight and run east to west so that doorways can face north and south for Feng Shui reasons. They vary in width — some are very narrow, enough for only a few pedestrians to pass through at a time.

Once ubiquitous in Beijing, siheyuans and hutongs are now rapidly disappearing, as entire city blocks of hutongs are leveled and replaced with high-rise buildings.    Residents of the hutongs are entitled to live in the new buildings, in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and street life of the hutongs cannot be replaced.    Residents, however, have limited control over their own property, as the government usually owns it.    Some particularly historic or picturesque neighbourhoods of hutongs are being preserved and restored by the government, especially for the 2008 Olympics.

Mandarin cuisine is the local style of cooking in Beijing. The Peking Roast Duck is perhaps the most well-known dish. The Manhan Quanxi ("Manchu-Han Chinese full banquet") is a rare traditional banquet originally intended for the ethnic-Manchu emperors of the Qing Dynasty; it remains very prestigious and expensive. The Fuling Jiabing is a traditional Beijing snack food, a pancake (bing) resembling a flat disk with filling, made from fu ling (Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf, or "tuckahoe"), an ingredient common in traditional Chinese medicine. Teahouses are also common in Beijing. Chinese tea comes in many varieties and some rather expensive types of Chinese tea are said to cure an ailing body extraordinarily well.

The cloisonné (or Jingtailan, literally "Blue of Jingtai") metalworking technique and tradition is a specialty of Beijing's cultural art, and is one of the most revered traditional crafts in China.    Cloisonné making requires elaborate and complicated processes which includes: base-hammering, copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface polishing and gilding.     Beijing's lacquerware is also well known for its sophisticated and intrinsic patterns and images carved into its surface, and the various decoration techniques of lacquer includes "carved lacquer" and "engraved gold".

Younger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife, which has flourished in recent decade, breaking prior cultural traditions that practically restricted it to the upper class.




Classical gardens in Beijing
At the heart of Beijing's historical centre lies the Forbidden City, the enormous palace compound that was the home of the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties;    the Forbidden City also hosts the Palace Museum, which contains imperial collections of Chinese art. Surrounding the Forbidden City are several former imperial gardens, parks and scenic areas, notably the Beihai, Houhai, Shichahai, Zhongnanhai, Jingshan and Zhongshan.  These places, like the Beihai Park are described to be masterpieces of Chinese gardening art,  Beihai Park. UNECO World Heritage Tentative Lists  and are popular tourist destinations with tremendous historical importance; Zhongnanhai during the modern era has also been the political heart of various Chinese governments and regimes and is now the headquarters of the Communist Party of China. From the Tiananmen Square, which is located right across the Forbidden City, there are several notable sites, such as the Tiananmen, Qianmen, the Great Hall of the People, National Museum of China, Monument to the People's Heroes, and Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace both lie at the western part of the urban city of Beijing; the Summer Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,    displays a comprehensive collection of imperial gardens and palaces that functioned as the summer retreat for the Qing Dynasty emperors.

Perhaps among the most well-known religious sites in the city is the Temple of Heaven (Tiantan), located in southeastern Beijing, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site,    where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties made visits for annual ceremonies of prayer to Heaven for good harvest; located in the opposite direction of the Temple of Heaven at the northern part of the city are the Temple of Earth (Ditian), and the Temple of the Sun (Ritan) and Temple of the Moon (Yuetan), both respectively located in the eastern and western parts of the urban area. Other well-known temple sites located in Beijing include the Dongyue Temple, Tanzhe Temple, Miaoying Temple, White Cloud Temple, Yonghe Temple, Fayuan Temple, Wanshou Temple and the Big Bell Temple. The city also has its own Confucius Temple, and a Guozijian. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception was built in 1605, and is the oldest Catholic church in Beijing. The Niujie Mosque is also the oldest mosque in Beijing, with a history over a thousand years old.

Beijing contains several well-preserved pagodas and stone pagodas, such as the towering Pagoda of Tianning Temple, which was built during the Liao Dynasty from 1100–1120, and the Pagoda of Cishou Temple, which was built in 1576 during the Ming Dynasty. Several historically important stone bridges are also located in Beijing, including the 12th century-built Lugou Bridge, the 17th century-built Baliqiao bridge and the 18th century-built Jade Belt Bridge. The Beijing Ancient Observatory displays pretelescopic spheres dating back to the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Fragrant Hills (Xiangshan) is a popular scenic public park that consists of natural landscape areas as well as traditional and cultural relics. The Beijing Botanical Garden exhibits over 6,000 species of plants, including a variety of trees, bushes and flowers, and an extensive peony garden. The Taoranting Park, Chaoyang Park, Haidian Park and Zizhu Yuan are all popular recreational parks that consist of a variety of natural landscapes. The Beijing Zoo is a center of zoological research that also contains rare animals from various continents, including the giant panda of China.

Beijing is also known for its siheyuan (courtyard houses) and hutong (alleys), although they are increasingly disappearing due to the growth of city constructions and are giving way to high-rises. The city has several well-preserved neighborhoods of shiheyuan, including some of the more grand courtyard houses, such as the Prince Gong Mansion. There are over hundreds of museums in Beijing,       and aside from the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China, other major museums include the National Art Museum of China, the Capital Museum, the Beijing Art Museum, the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Geological Museum of China, the Beijing Museum of Natural History and the Paleozoological Museum of China.

Located at the outskirts of urban Beijing but within its municipality are the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming Dynasty, the lavish and elaborate burial sites of thirteen Ming emperors, which have been designated as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties".    The archaeological Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian is another World Heritage Site within the Beijing municipality,    and it contains a wealth of discoveries, including one of the first specimens of Homo erectus, and an assemblage of bones of the gigantic hyena Pachycrocuta brevirostris. There are several sections of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Great Wall of China    that are on the outskirts of the municipality, most notably Badaling, Jinshanling, Simatai and Mutianyu.

Three radio stations feature programmes in English: Hit FM on FM 88.7, Easy FM by China Radio International (CRI) on FM 91.5, and the newly launched Radio 774 on AM 774. Beijing Radio Stations is the family of radio stations serving the city audience; its stations include the music station on 97.4 FM as well as a series of other stations focused on news, sports, educational programming, and others.



The well-known Beijing Evening News (Beijing Wanbao) newspaper is distributed every afternoon, covering news about Beijing in Chinese. Other newspapers include The Beijing News (Xin Jing Bao), the Beijing Star Daily, the Beijing Morning News, and the Beijing Youth Daily (Beijing Qingnian Bao), as well as English-language weeklies Beijing Weekend and Beijing Today (the English-language edition of Youth Daily). People's Daily and China Daily (English) are published in Beijing as well.  Nationally circulated Chinese newspapers are also available in Beijing.

Publications primarily aimed at international visitors and the expatriate community include the English-language periodicals City Weekend, Beijing This Month, Beijing Talk, That's Beijing and MetroZine.

The international press, including English and Japanese-language newspapers and magazines, are available in major international hotels and friendship stores, and content often appears complete.



Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2008 Summer Paralympics. City officials relocated 350,000 people for the construction of the Beijing National Stadium,    which was completed on 28 June 2008.   
Professional sports teams based in Beijing include:

*Chinese Super League
** Beijing Guoan
*Chinese Football Association Jia League‎
** Beijing Hongdeng
** Beijing Institute of Technology FC
*Chinese Basketball Association
** Beijing Ducks
*Women's Chinese Basketball Association
** Beijing Shougang
*Asia League Ice Hockey
** China Sharks
*China Baseball League
** Beijing Tigers

The Beijing Olympians of the ABA, formerly a CBA team, kept their name and maintained a roster of primarily Chinese players after moving to Maywood, California in 2005.




With the growth of the city following economic reforms, Beijing has evolved as the most important transportation hub in the People's Republic of China, and within the larger East Asian region. Encircling the city are five ring roads, nine expressways and city express routes, eleven China National Highways, several railway routes, and an international airport.

The Beijing Railway Station


Beijing has long been the largest railway hub in China. There are railway lines from Beijing to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Kowloon, Harbin, Qinhuangdao, Baotou, Yuanping, Chengde, and Tianjin. As of 1 August 2006, Beijing Railway Station has 167 trains stopping daily, while Beijing West Railway Station has 176 trains. These two railway stations serve as major transportation nodes in the city. The state-of-the-art Beijing South Railway Station opened in August 2008, and serves as the Beijing terminus for the Beijing-Tianjin high-speed train, the fastest regular passenger train service in the world, as well as all other high-speed CRH trains. International trains, including lines to Kowloon in Hong Kong, and cities in Mongolia, Russia, and North Korea, all run through Beijing.

Several other railway stations in urban Beijing handle regular passenger traffic: Beijing North, Beijing East, Fengtai and other smaller stations. There are also a number of other stations serving suburban areas. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their direction in relation to Beijing.

Beijing is connected via road links from all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Nine expressways of China (with six wholly new expressways under projection or construction) connect with Beijing, as do eleven China National Highways. Within Beijing itself, an elaborate network of five ring roads has developed, but they appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. Due partly to its design as an ancient capital, roads in Beijing often are in one of the four compass directions.

Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the five "ring roads" ( ) that successively surround the city, with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical centre for the ring roads. The 1st Ring road is not officially defined. The 2nd Ring Road is fully located in Beijing's inner city areas. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards, with the 5th Ring Road and 6th Ring Road being full-standard National expressways - linked to other roads only with interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward.

One of the biggest concerns with traffic in Beijing involves its apparently ubiquitous traffic jams, although in recent years ITS has been implemented in many areas in attempts to alleviate the problem. Traffic in the city centre is often gridlocked, especially around rush hour. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged up with traffic. Urban area ring roads and major thoroughfares, especially near Chang'an Avenue, are normally cited as high-congestion areas.

Exacerbating Beijing's traffic problems is its relatively underdeveloped mass transit system. Frequently cited is the city's subway system which has 8 lines for its 17 million citizens. In comparison, New York City has 26 lines for its 8 million citizens. Beijing's urban design layout further complicates the situation of the transportation system.    Compounding the problem is patchy enforcement of traffic regulations, and road rage. Beijing authorities claim that traffic jams may be a thing of a past come the 2008 Olympics. The authorities have introduced several bus lanes where, during rush hour, all vehicles except for public buses must keep clear.

Chang'an Avenue runs east-west through the centre of Beijing, past Tian'anmen. It is a major through route and is often called the "First Street in China" by authorities.



Beijing Capital International Airport's new Terminal 3
Beijing's primary airport is the Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK;  ) near Shunyi, which is about 20 km northeast of city centre. With renovations for the 2008 Olympics, the airport now boasts three terminals, with Terminal 3 being one of the largest in the world. Most domestic and nearly all international flights arrive at and depart from Capital Airport. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China. The capital links Beijing with almost every other Chinese city with regular air passenger service. It is linked to central Beijing by the Airport Expressway and is a roughly 40-minute drive from the city centre during good traffic hours. Prior to the 2008 Olympics, another expressway, the 2nd Airport Expressway, was built to the Airport, as well as a light rail system, which is now connected to the Beijing Subway.

Other airports in the city include Beijing Liangxiang Airport, Beijing Nanyuan Airport, Beijing Xijiao Airport, Beijing Shahe Airport and Beijing Badaling Airport. Nanyuan serves as the hub for only one passenger airline, and these airports are primarily for military use and less well-known to the public.



Line 5 platform at Dongdan station, with platform screen doors
The Beijing Subway system opened in 1971, and only consisted of two lines until the opening of the northern arc Line 13 in 2002. Due to recent expansion, the evolving system now has nine lines, four of which are underground, and five are above ground. Line 1, along with its new eastern expansion known as the Batong Line crosses almost all of urban Beijing from east to west. Line 5 serves as the north-south axial line. Fare is 2 yuan flat throughout. There is an extensive system nearly 700 bus and trolleybus routes in Beijing as of 2008, including three bus rapid transit routes.    All public transportation can be accessed with the Yikatong card, which uses radio frequencies to be scanned at subway stations and on public transit buses.

Registered taxis can be found throughout Beijing, although a large number of unregistered taxis also exist. As of 30 June 2008, all fares on legal taxis start at 10 Renminbi for the first 3 km and 2.00 Renminbi per additional kilometer, not counting idling fees. Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras, Hyundai Sonatas, Peugeot Citroëns and Volkswagen Jettas. After 15 km, the base fare is increased by 50% (but only applied to the portion of the distance over 15 km, so that the passenger is not retroactively charged extra for the first 15 km). Between 11 pm and 5 am, the fee is increased by 20%, starting at 11 RMB and increasing at a rate of 2.4 RMB per km. Rides over 15 km and between 11 pm and 6 am apply both charges, for a total increase of 80% (120%*150%=180%).



Tsinghua University is a top university in mainland China
Beijing is home to a great number of colleges and universities, including several well-regarded universities of international stature, such as Peking University and Tsinghua University.  Owing to Beijing's status as the political and cultural capital of China, a larger proportion of tertiary-level institutions are concentrated here than in any other city in China, reaching at least 59 in number. Many international students from Japan, Korea, North America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere come to Beijing to study every year. The institutions listed here are administered by China's Ministry of Education.

Copenhagen



Copenhagen ( ;    ) is the capital and largest city of Denmark, with a population of 1,161,063.    Copenhagen is situated on the Islands of Zealand and Amager.

First documented in the 11th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the beginning of the 15th century and during the 17th century under the reign of 
Christian IV it became an important regional centre. Copenhagen is usually ranked as one of the two largest cities of the Nordic Countries. [ LARGEST CITY Copenhagen or Stockholm ?  [ Denmark in brief .  With the completion of the transnational Oresund Bridge in 2000, Copenhagen has become the centre of the increasingly integrating Øresund Region with around 3.7 million inhabitants covering an area of 20,869 km² (177/km²).  Within this region, Copenhagen and Malmö is in the process of growing into one common metropolitan area.

Copenhagen is a major regional center of culture, business, media, and science. In 2008 Copenhagen was ranked #4 by Financial Times-owned FDi magazine on their list of Top50 European Cities of the Future after London, Paris and Berlin.    In the 2008 Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index, published by MasterCard, Copenhagen was ranked 14th in the world and 1st in Scandinavia.    Life science, information technology and shipping are important sectors and research & development plays a major role in the city's economy. Its strategic location and excellent infrastructure with the largest airport in Scandinavia    located 14 minutes by train from the city centre, has made it a regional hub and a popular location for regional headquarters    as well as conventions.

Copenhagen has repeatedly been recognized as one of the cities with the best quality of life.          and in 2008 it was singled out as the Most Liveable City in the World by international lifestyle magazine Monocle on their Top 25 Most Liveable Cities 2008 list.    It is also considered one of the world's most environmentally friendly cities with the water in the inner harbor being so clean that it can be used for swimming and 36 % of all citizens commuting to work by bicycle, every day bicycling a total 1.1 million km. Since the turn of the millennium Copenhagen has seen a strong urban and cultural development and has been described as a boom town.    This is partly due to massive investments in cultural facilities as well as infrastructure and a new wave of succesful designers, chefs and architects.



Copenhagen c. 1895

From its humble origins as a fishing village to its heyday as the glittering capital of the Danish Empire, to its current position as one of the world's premier design capitals, the stories and characters of Copenhagen's history can be discovered in its sumptuous palaces, copper-roofed town houses and atmospheric cobbled squares. 
From the Viking Age there was a fishing village by the name of "Havn" (harbour) at the site. Recent archeological finds indicate that by the 11th century, Copenhagen had already grown into a small town with a large estate, a church, a market, at least two wells and many smaller habitations spread over a fairly wide area.  Arkæologer graver ny teori om København op af mulden (Archeologists develop new theory about Copenhagen from their digs), Videnskab.dk, 5 November 2008  From the middle of the 12th century it grew in importance after coming into the possession of the Bishop Absalon, who fortified it in 1167, the year traditionally marking the foundation of Copenhagen. The excellent harbour encouraged Copenhagen's growth until it became an important centre of commerce.
The city's origin as a harbour and a place of commerce is reflected in its name. Its original designation, from which the contemporary Danish name is derived, was Køpmannæhafn, "merchants' harbor". The English name for the city is derived from its Low German name, Kopenhagen. The element hafnium is also named for Copenhagen, whose Latin name is Hafnia.  Biography of George de Hevesy

It was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League as the Germans took notice. In 1254, it received its charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen.

During 1658-59 it withstood a severe siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault. In 1801 a British fleet under Admiral Parker fought a major battle, the Battle of Copenhagen, with the Danish Navy in Copenhagen harbour. It was during this battle Lord Nelson famously "put the telescope to the blind eye" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to cease fire. When a British expeditionary force bombarded Copenhagen in 1807, to gain control of the Danish Navy, the city suffered great damage and hundreds of people were killed. The reason why the devastation was so great was that Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line rendered virtually useless by the 
increase in shooting range available to the British. But not until the 1850s were the ramparts of the city opened to allow new housing to be built around the lakes ("Søerne") which bordered the old defence system to the west. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, not only because the old ramparts were out of date as a defence system, but also because of bad sanitation in the old city. Before the opening, Copenhagen Center was inhabited by approximately 125,000 people, peaking in the census of 1870 (140,000); today the figure is around 25,000. In 1901, Copenhagen expanded further, incorporating communities with 40,000 people, and in the process making Frederiksberg an enclave within Copenhagen.

During World War II, Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. In August 1943, when the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbour by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent them being used by the Germans. The city has grown greatly since the war, in the seventies using the so-called five-finger-plan of commuter train lines to surrounding towns and suburbs.

Since the summer 2000, the cities of Copenhagen and Malmö have been connected by a toll bridge/tunnel (Øresund Bridge), which allows both rail and road passengers to cross. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area which spans both nations. The construction of the bridge has led to a large number of changes to the public transportation system and the extensive redevelopment of Amager, south of the main city.

Copenhagen is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand (Sjælland) and partly on the island of Amager. Copenhagen faces the Øresund to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from Sweden, and that connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. On the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen, lie the towns of Malmö and Landskrona.

Copenhagen is also a part of the Øresund region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in Denmark and Scania in Sweden.



Copenhagen Municipality is an administrative unit that covers the central part of the actual city of Copenhagen. It is a fairly small part of the actual city that falles within the municipality both because it covers a very confined area and because the enclave of Frederiksberg is an independent municipality. Copenhagen consists of a number of boroughs and areas, including
* Indre By
* Østerbro
* Nørrebro
* Vesterbro
* Amagerbro
* Nordhavnen (North Habour)
* Valby
* Kongens Enghave (King's Meadow Garden), also known as Sydhavnen (meaning South Harbour)
* Christianshavn
* Christiania (Freetown)
* Sundbyvester (Sundby West),
* Sundbyøster (Sundby East)
* Ørestad
* Islands Brygge
* Bellahøj
* Brønshøj
* Ryparken
* Bispebjerg
* Vigerslev
* Vestamager
* Vanløse

The suffix -bro in the names Østerbro, Nørrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro should not be confused with the Danish word for bridge, which is also 'bro'. The term is thought to be an abbreviation or short form of the Danish word brolagt meaning paved referring to the roads paved with cobblestones leading to the city's former gates -



The conurbation of Copenhagen consists of several municipalities. After Copenhagen Municipality, the second largest is Frederiksberg Municipality which is an enclave inside Copenhagen Municipality. Both are contained in the larger Capital Region of Denmark, which contains most of the Copenhagen metropolitan area.

Previously, the areas of Frederiksberg, Gentofte and Copenhagen municipalities have been used to define the city of Copenhagen. This definition is now obsolete. To meet statistical needs after the latest municipal reform, which took place in the beginning of 2007, an effort has been made to work out definitions of lands (landsdele) in Denmark. A land is basically a geographical and statistical definition, and the area is not considered to be an administrative unit. The land of Copenhagen City includes the municipalities of Copenhagen, Dragør, Frederiksberg and Tårnby, with a total population of 656,582 in the beginning of 2008.   Statistics Denmark, table BEF1A07: Population 1 January by region, age, sex, marital status Retrieved on 2008-03-26.     Statistics Denmark, definitions of lands as of 2007-01-01 (excel-file, in danish) Retrieved on 2008-03-26.

Copenhagen and Frederiksberg were two of the three last Danish municipalities not belonging to a county. On 1 January 2007, the municipalities lost their county privileges and became part of Copenhagen Capital Region.



Suburban Copenhagen is planned according to the  Finger Plan, fingerplanen, initiated in 1947, dividing the suburbs into five fingers.  The Finger Plan, Denmark.dk  The S-train lines  are built according to the Finger Plan, while green wedges and highways are built in-between the fingers

The Little Finger

The northern suburbs form the little finger of the plan, and is traditionally the wealthiest of the suburbs. In popular language, the area is known as "The Whiskey Belt", although the area is mixed between mansions, larger houses, garden cities and mid-size houses. The area has a population of around 270,000 inhabitants.

* Gentofte Municipality: Klampenborg, Skovshoved, Charlottenlund, Hellerup, Gentofte, Ordrup, Jægersborg, Dyssegård, Vangede
* Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality: Kongens Lyngby, Ulrikkenborg, Brede, Virum, Sorgenfri, Lundtofte, Hjortekær
* Rudersdal Municipality: Søllerød, Holte, Øverød, Gl. Holte, Trørød, Nærum, Vedbæk, Skodsborg, Birkerød, Kajerød, Bistrup
* Hørsholm Municipality: Hørsholm, Usserød, Rungsted, Vallerød, Smidstrup
* Allerød Municipality: Allerød, Lillerød, Blovstrød
* Fredensborg Municipality: Fredensborg, Asminderød, Humlebæk, Kokkedal, Niverød, Nivå.

The Ring Finger
The North-Northwestern part of the suburbs forms the ring finger. The area is to a large extent formed by detached middle-class dwellings, with some exceptions of housing projects or upper-class areas. The area has a population of around 100,000 inhabitants.

* Gladsaxe Municipality: Gladsaxe, Bagsværd, Buddinge, Høje-Gladsaxe (Gladsaxe Heights), Mørkhøj, Søborg
* Furesø Municipality: Værløse, Farum, Hareskovby

The Middle Finger
The northwestern suburbs form the middle finger, and consists of a mixed area of both detached middle-class dwellings, widespread garden cities and large, low-rise public housing projects. The area has a considerable part of the industrial areas of metropolitan Copenhagen, mostly in the traditional sectors of manufacturing. The area has a population of around 110,000 inhabitants.

* Herlev Municipality: Herlev, Hjortespring
* Ballerup Municipality: Skovlunde, Ballerup, Måløv, Ågerup, Jonstrup, Egebjerg
* Egedal Municipality: Smørumnedre, Stenløse, Ølstykke

The Index Finger
The index finger forms the western suburbs, which are the suburbs with the lowest income per capita and the highest crime-rate. The suburbs vary from the petit bourgeois area of Glostrup to the widespread low housing projects of Albertslund and Taastrup. Of the total of 145,000 inhabitants, some 20% are immigrants of first or second generation.

* Rødovre Municipality: Rødovre, Islev
* Glostrup Municipality: Glostrup, Hvissinge, Ejby
* Brøndby Municipality: Brøndbyøster, Brøndbyvester, Brøndby Nord 
* Albertslund Municipality
* Høje-Taastrup Municipality: Taastrup, Høje-Taastrup, Tåstrupgård, Hedehusene

The Thumb
The southwest suburbs along the coast form the thumb of the plan. While the central parts of these suburbs are dominated by high-rise housing projects and low-income inhabitants, the distant part is dominated by detached middle-class houses. These suburbs have a population of some 215,000 inhabitants and has a sizeable number of immigrants.

* Hvidovre Municipality: Avedøre, Friheden, Hvidovre
* Brøndby Municipality: Brøndby Strand
* Vallensbæk Municipality
* Ishøj Municipality
* Greve Municipality: Hundige, Karlslunde, Greve
* Solrød Municipality: Solrød, Jersie
* Køge municipality: Køge, Ølby

The extra finger: Amager Island suburbs & Malmö
When the finger plan was initially introduced, the island of Amager wasn't included as the infrastructure was inadequate for modern suburban life. Later it has been improved, and the suburbs at the island hold some 53,000 inhabitants. Amager is now one of the most modern suburbs of Copehagen with increasing wealth. With the opening of the bridge to Sweden this finger has been extended all the way to Malmö. Under an official visit of the Swedish King in 2007 at the Copenhagen City Hall, Copenhagen Lord Mayor Ritt Bjerregaard caused a minor diplomatic incident by referring to Malmö as "København M" with an allusion to the Danish system of postal codes (Nørrebro being København N and Vesterbro being København V for instance), indicating that Malmö had turned into just another Copenhagen bourough. Today 25,000 Danes live in Malmö.  Malmø er blevet til København M, DR Online

* Tårnby Municipality: Tårnby, Kastrup
* Dragør Municipality



Summers in Copenhagen are mild with average high temperatures of around 21°C (70°F) and lows of 13°C (55°F), but temperatures could sometimes exceed 25°C (77°F+) and occasional heatwaves are common during the summer. Winters are cold, with temperatures of -2 to 4°C (28 - 40°F), and it rarely drop below −10 °C (14 °F).

Precipitation is moderate throughout the year, and snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow cover does not remain a long time.

The city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played  as a regional center for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each representing its time and with its own distinctive character, making up a dense urban fabric. Other distinctive features of the Copenhagen of today is the abundance of water, the greenness and the elaborate system of bicycle paths that line almost every major street.




The oldest section of Copenhagen's inner city is often referred to as "Middelalderbyen" (The Medieval City). However, the most distinctive district of Copenhagen is Frederiksstaden developed during the reign of Frederick V. It has Amalienborg Palace at its centre and is dominated by the dome of the Marble Church as well as a number of elegant 18th century mansions. Also part of the old inner city of Copenhagen is the small island of Slotsholmen with Christiansborg Palace and Christianshavn. Around the historical city center lies a band of charming, dense and well-preserved residential bouroughs (Vesterbro, Inner Nørrebro, Inner Østerbro) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts of the city when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond this barrier.

Sometimes referred to as "the City of Spires", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, only broken by spires at churches and castles. Most characteristic is the baroque spire of Church of Our Saviour with its spiralling and narrowing external stairs that visitors can climb to the very top of the spire. Other important spires are those of  Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. A bit lower are the renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the "dragon spire" of [[Christian IV of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it is shaped as the tails of four dragons twined together.

Recent years has seen a tremendous boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen both when it comes to Danish architecture and works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen but since the mid 1990s the city and its immediate sourroundings have seen buildings and projects from such international star architects as Norman Foster   , Hadid   , Nouvel    and Liebeskind   . In the same time, a number of Danish architects have achieved great success both in Copenhagen and abroad. This has led to a number of international architecture awards. Buildings in Copenhagen have won RIBA European Awards four years in a row ("Sampension" in 2005   , "Kilen" in 2006   , "Tietgenkollegiet" in 2007    and the Royal Playhouse in 2008   ). At the 2008 World Architecture Festival in Barcelona, Bjarke Ingels Group won an award for the World's Best Residential Building 2008 for a house in Ørestad.    The Forum AID Award for Best building in Scandinavia went to Copenhagen buildings both in 2006    and 2008   . In 2008 British design magazine Monocle named Copenhagen the World's best design city 2008.

The boom in urban development and modern architecture means that the above mentioned horizontal skyline has seen some changes. A political majority has decided to keep the historical center free of highrises. But several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development.

Ørestad is the area that until now has seen most of the development. Located near  Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts the largest mall in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as an IT University and a high school. The two largest hotels in Scandinavia are currently under construction (ultimo 2008).

An ambitious regeneration project will create a new Carlsberg District at the historical premises of the Carlsberg Breweries that has terminated the production of beer in Copenhagen and moved it to Jutland. The district will have a total of nine highrises and seeks to mix the old industrial buildings with modern architecture to create a dense, maze-like quarter with a focus on sustainability and an active  urban life. A third major area of urban development also with a focus on sustanibility is Nordhavn. The Copenhagen tradition with urban development on artificial islands that was initiated with with Christianh IV's construction of Christianshavn has recently been continued with the creation of Havneholmen as well as a "canal city" in the South Harbour.

A district in Copenhagen with a very different take on modern architecture is that of Christiania whose many creative and idiosyncratic buildings are exponents of an "architecture without architects".




Østre Anlæg
University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden
Copenhagen is a green city with many big and small parks. King's Garden, the garden of Rosenborg Castle, is the oldest and most visited park in Copenhagen.    Its landscaping was commenced by Christian IV in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2,5 million visitors    and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picknickers and ballplayers. It also serves as a sculpture garden with a permanent display of sculptures as well as temporary exhibits during summer.    Also located in the city centre are the Botanical Gardens particularly noted for their large complex of 19th century greenhouses donated by  Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen.    Fælledparken is with its 58 hectars the largest park in Copenhagen.    It is popular for sports and hosts a long array of annual events like a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, carnival, Labour Day celebrations and Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix which is a race for antique cars. A historical green space in the northeastern part of the city is Kastellet which is a well-presserved renaissance citadel that now serves mainly as a park. Another popular park is the Frederiksberg Garden which is a 32 hectars romantic landscape park. It houses a large colony of very tame grey herons along with other waterfowls. The park also offers views of the elephants and the elephant house designed by world-famous British architect Norman Foster of the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo.

Characteristic of Copenhagen is that a number of cemeteries double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation.    Assistens Cemetery, the burrial place of Hans Christian Andersen among others, is an important green space for the district of Inner Nørrebro and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known Vestre Kirkegaard is with its 54 hectars the largest cemetery in Denmark    and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other garden features.

It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that all citizens by 2015 must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes.    In line with this policy, several new parks are under development in areas poor in green spaces.



Copenhagen and the surrounding areas have 3 beaches with a total of approx. 8 km of sandy beaches within 30 minutes of bicycling from the city centre. This includes Amager Strandpark, which opened in 2005 and includes a 2 km long artificial island and a total of 4,6 km of beaches   , located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre.

The beaches are supplemented by a system of harbour baths along the Copenhagen waterfront. The first and most popular of these is located at Islands Brygge  Harbour bath at Islands Brygge, e-architect  and has won international acclaim for its design.

Depending on the boundaries used, the population of Copenhagen differs. Statistics Denmark uses a measure of the contiguously built-up urban area of Copenhagen, this means the number of communities included in this statistical abstract has changed several times, in the abstracts latest edition with close to 1.2 million (1,153,615 (2008)) inhabitants. This number is not a strict result of the commonly-used measuring methods of 200 meters of continuously build-up area, as there are exceptions to the general rule in the suburbs of Dragør, Taastrup, Birkerød, Hørsholm and Farum.  Statistics Denmark has never stated the geographical area of urban Copenhagen. However, we know it consists of Copenhagen Municipality, Frederiksberg and 16 of the 20 municipalities in the old counties Copenhagen and Roskilde, though 5 of them only partially. Largest cities of Denmark 2007

Statistics Denmark has worked out definitions of so-called lands (landsdele), a definition used to meet statistical needs on a lower level than regions. From this, the land of Copenhagen city (København by) is defined by the municipalities of Copenhagen, Dragør, Frederiksberg and Tårnby, with a total population of 656,582 in the beginning of 2008.   The surroundings of Copenhagen is defined by another land, Copenhagen suburban (Københavns omegn), which includes the municipalities of Albertslund, Ballerup, Brøndby, Gentofte, Gladsaxe, Glostrup, Herlev, Hvidovre, Høje-Taastrup, Ishøj, Lyngby-Taarbæk, Rødovre and Vallensbæk, and with a total population of 504,481 (January 1, 2008).   This gives a total population of 1,161,063 for these two lands together. The lands of Copenhagen city and Copenhagen suburban can together be used as a definition of the metropolitan area, although perhaps a somewhat narrow one.

From 1 January 2008 the population of the 34 municipalities closest to and including the municipality of Copenhagen is 1,857,263 and by 1 October 2008 the population of this area had grown to 1,872,706. Statistikbanken.dk Population table BEF1A07  Land area: 2,923 km² (1,032 sq mi). (Capital Region - Bornholm + East Zealand + Stevns) Water area: 105 km² (40.5 sq mi). Orienteering fra Københavns Kommune. Statistisk Kontor.2003 nr. 25   Thus, the region comprises 6.8% of the land area of Denmark, but has 34% of Denmark's population. This gives a total of 641 inhabitants per km² or 1,660 per square mile for the region. This compares with a population density in the rest of the country of approximately 90 per km² or around 230 per square mile.

Based on a 10%-isoline (data from 2002) in which at least 10% commutes into central parts of the Copenhagen area, most of Zealand would be covered and this area has a population of about 2.3 million inhabitants.  /ref>

The first settlement on the territory of Budapest was Ak-Ink ( ) built by Celts  before the birth of Christ. It was later occupied by the Romans. The Roman settlement - Aquincum - became the main city of Lower Pannonia  in 106 AD . The Romans constructed roads, amphitheaters, baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified military camp   .

The Hungarians led by Árpád settled in the territory at the end of the 9th century Molnar, A Concise History of Hungary, Chronology pp. 12   , and a century later officially founded the Kingdom of Hungary . Research places the probable residence of the Árpáds an early place of central power near what became Budapest.  Molnar, A Concise History of Hungary, p. 14   The Tatar invasion in the 13th century quickly proved that defence is difficult on a plain  . King Béla IV of Hungary therefore ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the towns  and set his own royal palace  on the top of the protecting hills of Buda. In 1361  it became the capital of Hungary .

Buda Castle during the Middle Ages.
The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary . The Italian Renaissance had a great influence on the city . His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana , was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second only in size to the Vatican Library . After the foundation of the first Hungarian university in Pécs in 1367    the second one was established in Óbuda in 1395 . The first Hungarian book was printed in Buda in 1473   .

The Turkish occupation lasted for more than 140 years . The Turks constructed some fine bathing facilities here . The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the Habsburg Empire as Royal Hungary. In 1686 Leopold I liberated Buda from the Ottomans but almost destroyed the city during the battle . Hungary was then incorporated into the Habsburg Empire .

The nineteenth century was dominated by the Hungarians' struggle for independence  and modernization. The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 1848 and was defeated a little more than a year later.

The Hungarian State Opera House, built in the time of Austria-Hungary
1867 was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria-Hungary.

This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, Óbuda (Ancient Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub.

Cutaway Drawing of Millennium Underground in Budapest (1894-1896) which was the first underground in Continental Europe

World War I brought the Golden Age to an end. In 1918 Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic. In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon finalized the country's partition, as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, about two-thirds of its inhabitants under the treaty including 3.3 million out of 10 million ethnic Hungarians.

In 1944, towards the end of World War II, Budapest was partly destroyed by British and American air raids. From December 24, 1944 to February 13, 1945, the city was besieged during the Battle of Budapest. Budapest suffered major damage caused by the attacking Soviet troops and the defending German and Hungarian troops. All bridges were destroyed by the Germans. More than 38,000 civilians lost their lives during the conflict.

Between 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died through Nazi and Arrow Cross genocide during 1944 and early 1945.       Despite this, modern day Budapest has the highest number of Jewish citizens per capita of any European city.

In 1949, Hungary was declared a communist People's Republic. The new Communist government considered the buildings like the Buda Castle symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed.

In 1956, peaceful demonstrations in Budapest led to the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution. The Stalinist dictatorship collapsed after mass demonstrations, but Soviet tanks entered Budapest to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until early November, leaving more than 3000 dead.

From the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as "the happiest barrack" within the Eastern bloc, and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on Erzsébet Bridge, the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1965. In the early 1970s, Budapest Metro's East-West M2 line was first opened, followed by the M3 line in 1982. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Andrassy Avenue (including the Millennium Underground Railway, Hősök tere and Városliget) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s the city's population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant decrease in habitants occured mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in Pest county.
In the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989-90 concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of  Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were taken into a museum called Memento Park.



A view of Pest from the Buda side of the Danube
The 525km 2  area of Budapest lies in central Hungary surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends 25 and 29 kilometers in the north-south, east-west direction respectively. The Danube enters the city from the north; later it encircles two islands, Óbuda Island and Margaret Island . The third island Csepel Island is the largest of the Budapest Danube islands, however only it's northernmost tip is within city limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is only   wide at its narrowest point in Budapest. Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly . Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably Gellért Hill and Castle Hill. The Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created speleothems, the most famous ones being the Pálvölgyi cave and the Szemlőhegyi cave. The hills were formed in the Triassic Era. The highest point of the hills and of Budapest is János hill, at 527 meters above sea level. The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is 96 meters above see level. The forests of Buda hills are environmentally protected.




Budapest has a temperate, transitional climate - somewhere between the mild, rainy weather of Transdanubia, the variable continental climate of the flat and open Great Plain to the east and the almost sub-Mediterranean weather of the south.   .

In 1910 Budapest had 880,371 residents (85.9% Hungarian, 9% German, 2.3% Slovak, 2.8% other). Religions: 59.8% Roman Catholic, 23.1% Jewish, 9.9% Calvinist, 4.9% Lutheran, 2.3% other.  County maps of the Hungarian Kingdom (1913)




Originally Budapest had 10 districts after coming into existence upon the unification of the three cities in 1873. On 1 January, 1950 Budapest was united with several neighboring towns and the number of its districts was raised to 22 (Greater Budapest). At that time there were changes both in the order of districts and in their sizes. Now there are 23 districts, 6 in Buda, 16 in Pest and 1 on Csepel Island between them. Each district can be associated with one or more city parts named after former towns within Budapest.



Hungarian Parliament Building

The neo-Gothic Parliament, containing amongst other things the Hungarian Crown Jewels.

The  Hungarian cuisine and café culture: for example, Gerbeaud Café, and the Százéves, Biarritz, Fortuna, Alabárdos, Arany Szarvas, Kárpátia and the world famous Mátyás Pince Restaurants.
There are Roman remains at the Aquincum Museum, and historic furniture at the Nagytétény Castle Museum.

The Castle Hill, the River Danube embankments and the whole of Andrássy út have been officially recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
The Holy Crown of Hungary,  a key symbol of Hungary.
Castle Hill and the Castle District; there are three churches here, six museums, and a host of interesting buildings, streets and squares. The former Royal Palace is one of the symbols of Hungary – and has been the scene of battles and wars ever since the thirteenth century. Nowadays it houses two impressive museums and the National Széchenyi Library. The nearby Sándor Palace contains the offices and official residence of the President of Hungary. The seven-hundred year-old Matthias Church is one of the jewels of Budapest. Next to it is an equestrian statue of the first king of Hungary, King Saint Stephen, and behind that is the Fisherman's Bastion, from where opens out a panoramic view of the whole city.  Statues of the Turul, the mythical guardian bird of Hungary, can be found in both the Castle District and the Twelfth District.

In Pest, arguably the most important sight is Andrássy út. As far as Kodály Körönd and Oktogon both sides are lined with large shops and flats built close together. Between there and Heroes’ Square the houses are detached and altogether grander. Under the whole runs continental Europe’s oldest Underground railway, most of whose stations retain their original appearance. Heroes’ Square is dominated by the Millenary Monument, with the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front. To the sides are the Museum of Fine Arts and the Palace of Arts, and behind City Park opens out, with Vajdahunyad Castle. One of the jewels of Andrássy út is the Hungarian State Opera House. Statue Park, a theme park with striking statues of the Communist era, is located just outside the main city and is accessible by public transport.

The city is home to the largest synagogue in Europe (Dohány Street Synagogue)   , the largest medicinal bath in Europe (Széchenyi Medicinal Bath) and the third largest Parliament building in the world, once the largest in the world. The third largest church in Europe (Esztergom Basilica) and the second largest Baroque castle in the world (Gödöllő) are in the vicinity.



Széchenyi Thermal Bath

Seven islands can be found on the Danube: Hajógyári sziget (literal translation: Shipyard Island), Margit-sziget (Margaret Island), and Csepel sziget (the northernmost part of this island belonging to Budapest is a separate district of the city, the XXI., while the other islands are parts of other districts, the III. and XIII. respectively), Palotai-sziget (in fact, it's a peninsula today), Népsziget (connected to the above, but mostly surrounded by water), Háros-sziget and Molnár-sziget.

Notable islands:
*Margit-sziget is a   long island and   in area. The island mostly consists of a park and is a popular recreational area for tourists and locals alike. The island lies between bridges Margaret Bridge (south) and Árpád Bridge (north). Dance clubs, Swimming pools, an Aqua park, athletic and fitness centres, bicycle and running tracks can be found around the Island. During the day the island is occupied by people doing sports, or just resting. In the summer (generally on the weekends) mostly young people go to the island at night to party in its terraces, or to recreate with a bottle of alcohol on a bench or on the grass (this form of entertainment is sometimes referred to as bench-partying).
*Csepel-sziget [ˈtʃɛpɛlsigɛt] or Csepel Island is the largest island of the River Danube in Hungary. It is   long; its width is 6–8 km (3.75 5 mi) and its area comprises  , whereas only the northern tip is inside the city limits.
*Hajógyári-sziget [ˈhɒjo:ɟa:ri sigɛt] (or Óbudai-sziget) is a man built island, located in the third district. This island hosts many activities such as: wake-boarding, jet-skiing during the day, and dance clubs during the night. This is the island where the famous Sziget Festival takes place, hosting hundreds of  performances per year and now around 400,000 visitors in its last edition. Many building projects are taking place to make this island into one of the biggest entertainment centres of Europe, the plan is to build Apartment buildings, hotels, casinos and a marina.
*Luppa-sziget is the smallest island of Budapest, located in the north region.



Budapest Ferihegy International Airport 
Budapest Ferihegy International Airport, which has 3 passenger terminals: Ferihegy 1, which tends to serve the many discount airlines now flying to and from Budapest, Ferihegy 2/A and Ferihegy 2/B. Terminal 2/C is planned to be built. The airport is located to the east of the centre in the XVIII. district in Pestszentlőrinc.



Budapest is the most important Hungarian road terminus; all the major highways end there. Budapest is also a major railway terminus.

Ring road M0 around Budapest is made and allows people to go around Budapest from East to West and from North to South, however there is no way from West to North - you only need to go around to the South.




Map of the Budapest Metro
Budapest public transport is provided by BKV   , the company operates buses, trolleybuses, trams, suburban railway lines, the metro, a boat service, a cogwheel railway and a chairlift, called Libegő.

Budapest's tram network is extensive, and reliable despite poor track infrastructure and an ageing fleet. Routes 4 and 6 combined form the busiest traditional city tram line in the world, with the world's longest passenger trams (  long  Siemens Combino) running at 60 to 90 second intervals at peak time and 3–4 minutes off-peak and usually packed with people.

Day services operate from 4:30 a.m. until 11:30 p.m. each day. Night traffic (a reduced overnight service) has a reputation for being excellent .

There are three metro lines and a fourth is currently under construction.  The Yellow line, built in 1896, is one of the oldest subway lines in the world, following London Underground and the Istanbul Metro that were built respectively in 1863 and 1875.



Budapest Castle Hill Funicular 
Beside metros, suburban rails, buses, trams and boats, there are a couple of less usual vehicles in Budapest:
* trolleybus (trolibusz) on several lines in Pest
* funicular (sikló); the Castle Hill Funicular between the Chain Bridge and Buda Castle
* cyclecar (bringóhintó) for rent in Margaret Island
* chairlift (libegő)
* rack railway (fogaskerekű vasút); the Budapest Cog-wheel Railway 
* children's railway (gyermekvasút) 
The latter three vehicles run among Buda hills.




Hungarian main-line railways are operated by MÁV. There are three main railway termini in Budapest, Keleti (eastern), Nyugati (westbound), and Déli (southbound), operating both domestic and international rail services. Budapest was one of the main stops of the Orient Express until 2001, when the service was cut back to Paris-Vienna.
Nyugati Railway Station 
There is also a suburban rail service in and around Budapest, operated under the name HÉV.



The river Danube flows through Budapest on its way to the Black Sea. The river is easily navigable and so Budapest has historically been a major commercial port (at Csepel). In the summer months a scheduled hydrofoil service operates up the Danube to Vienna.

Helsinki



Helsinki (in Finnish;  ), or Helsingfors (in Swedish;  ) is the capital and largest city of Finland. It is in the southern part of Finland, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland, by the Baltic Sea. The population of the city of Helsinki is   ( ),  making it the most populous municipality in Finland by a wide margin. The foreign-born population stands at around 10%.

Helsinki, along with the neighbouring cities of Vantaa (Vanda), Espoo (Esbo), and Kauniainen (Grankulla), constitutes what is known as the capital region, with over 1,000,000 inhabitants. The Greater Helsinki area contains 12 municipalities and has a population of over 1,300,000.  The Greater Helsinki accounts for a quarter of the population of Finland, 29% of jobs, and a third of the GDP.

Helsinki is Finland's capital for business, education, research, culture, and government. Greater Helsinki has eight universities and six technology parks.  Helsinki region in brief  Some 70% of foreign companies operating in Finland have settled in the Helsinki region.  The immigration of rural residents has made it one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in Europe.

Finland's main international airline hub, Helsinki-Vantaa Airport is 40 minutes from the city center, with direct flights around the world. The busy Helsinki–Tallinn route takes 1.5 hours by sea and 18 minutes by helicopter. Two other big cities in Finland, Tampere and Turku, can be reached in 1.5–2 hours by train  VR Passenger Service   and 1.5–2.5 hours by car.




The Swedish name   (  or  ) is the original name of the city of Helsinki, and is still the official Swedish name for the city. The Finnish name, Helsinki (pronounced with the stress on the first syllable:  ), has been dominant in other languages for decades. The Swedish name Helsingfors comes from the name of the surrounding parish, Helsinge (source for Finnish Helsinki) and the rapids (in Swedish: fors), which flowed through the original town. It is often thought that the name Helsinge was given by the Swedish immigrants who came from the Swedish province of Hälsingland. Another explanation is that the names Helsingborg and Helsingør have derived from the Scandinavian word hals (neck), referring to the narrowest part of the river, i.e. the rapids   Utbildning & Vetenskap: Svenskfinland  .

In Helsinki slang the town is also called Stadi (from the Swedish word stad, meaning city) and Hesa in colloquial Finnish.   is the North Sami name of Helsinki.



Central Helsinki in 1820 before rebuilding. Drawing by Carl Ludvig Engel.

Founded in 1550 as a rival to the Hanseatic city of Reval (today: Tallinn) by King Gustav I of Sweden, the town of Helsinki struggled in its infancy. The fledgling settlement was plagued by poverty, wars, and diseases. For a long time it remained a small coastal town, overshadowed by the more thriving trade centers in the Baltic region. The construction of the Sveaborg (In Finnish Viapori, today also Suomenlinna) naval fortress helped improve its status, but it was not until Russia defeated Sweden in the Finnish War and annexed Finland as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809 that Helsinki began to develop into a major city.

In order to reduce Swedish influence in Finland, Czar Alexander I of Russia moved the capital from Turku, which had close ties to Sweden, to Helsinki. The Royal Academy of Turku, back then the only university in the country, was relocated to Helsinki in 1827 and eventually became the modern University of Helsinki. The move consolidated the city's new role, and the following decades saw unprecedented growth and development for the city, creating the prerequisites for the birth of the modern world class capital in the 20th century. This transformation is highly apparent in the downtown core, which was rebuilt in neoclassical style to resemble St. Petersburg. As elsewhere, technological advancements such as railroads and industrialization were a key factor behind the growth.



In the 1918 Finnish Civil War, Helsinki fell to the Red Guard on January 28, the first day of the war. The Red side gained control of the whole of southern Finland after minor hostilities. The Senate was relocated to Vaasa, although some senators and officials remained in hiding in the capital. After the tide of war turned against the Red forces, German troops fighting on the side of the Finnish White Guard recaptured Helsinki in April 1918. Unlike Tampere, Helsinki suffered relatively little damage in the war. After the White victory many former Red soldiers and collaborators were confined in prison camps across the country. The largest camp, having approximately 13,300 prisoners, was located on the former naval fortress island of Suomenlinna in Helsinki. Although the civil war left a considerable scar on the society, the standard of living in the country and the city began to improve in the following decade.  Renowned architects such as Eliel Saarinen created utopistic plans for Helsinki, but they were never realized to full extent.

In the aerial bombings of the Winter War (1939–40) and the Continuation War (1941–44) Helsinki was attacked by Soviet bombers. The most intense air raids took place in the spring of 1944, when over two thousand Soviet planes dropped some 16,000 bombs in and around the city. However, due to successful air defense the city was spared from the large-scale destruction that many other cities in Europe under bombings of similar scale suffered. Only a small number of bombs hit populated areas.

Despite the tumultuous first half of the 20th century, Helsinki continued to develop steadily.  The rapid urbanization of the 1970s, which occurred relatively late in the European context, tripled the population in the metropolitan area, making the Helsinki metropolitan area one of the fastest growing urban centers in the European Union in the 1990s. The relatively sparse population density of Helsinki and its peculiar structure have often been attributed to the lateness of the urbanisation. Thus today the Helsinki metropolitan area is the second most sparsely populated EU-capital after Brussels.  1 January 2007, Hufvudstadsbladet – Helsingfors en metropol om hundra år.

Helsinki is spread across a number of bays and peninsulas and over a number of islands. The inner city area occupies a southern peninsula, which is rarely referred to by its actual name Vironniemi. Population density in certain parts of Helsinki's inner city area is very high, reaching   in the district of Kallio, but as a whole Helsinki's population density of   ranks it as quite sparsely populated in comparison to other European capital cities. Much of Helsinki outside the inner city area consists of postwar suburbs separated from each other by patches of forests. A narrow, ten kilometer (6.2 mi) long Helsinki Central Park that stretches from the inner city to the northern border of Helsinki is an important recreational area for residents.

Some notable islands in Helsinki include Seurasaari, Lauttasaari and Korkeasaari   which is also the country's biggest zoo   as well as the fortress island of Suomenlinna (Sveaborg) and the military island of Santahamina.




The city has a temperate continental climate. Owing to the mitigating influence of the Baltic sea and Gulf stream, temperatures in winter are much higher than the northern location might suggest, with the average in January and February around −5 °C. Temperatures below −20 °C occur normally only for a week or two in a year. However, because of the latitude, days lasts less than six hours in the winter solstice, and the very cloudy weather accentuates the darkness. Conversely, Helsinki enjoys long days in summer, almost nineteen hours at the summer solstice. The average maximum temperature June through August is around 19 to 21 °C.

Carl Ludvig Engel (1778–1840) designed several neo-classical buildings in Helsinki. He was kept in Helsinki by a unique assignment, as he was elected to plan a new city centre all on his own. The city became shallow and wide at the time when most buildings had only two or three floors. The central point of Engel's city plan is the Senate Square, surrounded by the Government's Palace, the main building of the University, and the enormous Cathedral, which was finished in 1852, twelve years after C. L. Engel's death. Engels' neo-classical plan of the city centre has later given Helsinki the epithet The White City Of The North.

Helsinki is, however, perhaps even more famous for its numerous Art Nouveau (Jugend in Finnish) buildings, designed in the early 1900s and strongly influenced by the Kalevala, which is a very popular theme in the national romantic art of that era. Helsinki's Art Nouveau style is also featured in large residential areas such as Katajanokka and Ullanlinna. The master of the Finnish Art Nouveau was Eliel Saarinen (1873–1950), whose architectural masterpiece was the Helsinki central railway station.

Helsinki also features several buildings by the world-renowned Finnish architect Alvar Aalto (1898–1976), attributed as one of the pioneers in functionalism. Many of Aalto's works are either loved or hated. Aalto's buildings, such as the headquarters of the paper company Enso and the concert and congress house Finlandia Hall, have sparked much debate amongst Helsinki's inhabitants.

In addition to Aalto's work, there is a body of other noteworthy functionalist architecture in Helsinki, such as the Olympic Stadium, the Tennis Palace, the Rowing Stadium, the Swimming Stadium, the Velodrome, the Glass Palace, the Exhibition Hall (now Töölö Sports Hall) and Helsinki-Malmi Airport. The sports venues were built to serve the 1940 Helsinki Olympic Games (canceled due to the Second World War), but eventually got to fulfill their purpose in the 1952 Olympic Games. Many of them are listed by DoCoMoMo as significant examples of modern architecture. The Olympic Stadium and Helsinki-Malmi Airport are in addition catalogued by the National Board of Antiquities as cultural-historical environments of national significance.

During the 1960s and 1970s many aesthetically and historically important houses were swiftly demolished to make room for the rapidly expanding city and instead houses presenting more values of functionalism were built. This has later been widely regarded as a bad move and has led to a strong protectionism of old buildings in Helsinki. The plans made during the era of rapid growth expected Helsinki to have well over one million inhabitants at the turn of the millennium. Much due to the strong protectionism of today there are still many areas left with distinctive old wooden houses, such as Käpylä, Kumpula, Toukola and Puu-Vallila.

As a historical footnote, Helsinki's neoclassical buildings were often used as a backdrop for scenes set to take place in the Soviet Union in many Cold War era Hollywood movies. Some of the more notable ones are The Kremlin Letter (1970), Reds (1981) and Gorky Park (1983). Because some of the streetscapes were reminiscent of Leningrad's and Moscow's old buildings, they were used in the production - much to some residents' dismay. At the same time the government secretly briefed its white-collar workers to make producing these, often clearly Soviet-negative, films in Helsinki as hard as possible due to diplomatic pressure from Moscow.

Helsinki has eighty-five members in its city council. The three largest parties are National Coalition (26), Greens (21), and Social Democrats (16).



The population of Helsinki is predominantly Finnish-speaking, with a sizable Swedish-speaking minority ( ). Also, 6.4% of the population are foreign citizens, and   have a first language other than Finnish or Swedish.

The city has Finland's largest immigrant population in both absolute and relative terms. There are people of over 130 nationalities resident in Helsinki. The largest groups are from Russia, Estonia, Sweden, but also large numbers of residents from Somalia, Serbia, China, India, Iraq and Germany.



Kamppi Center is a shopping and transportation complex in the Kamppi district in the centre of Helsinki.

The Helsinki metropolitan area generates approximately one third of Finland's GDP. 
GDP per capita is roughly 1.5 times the national average, making Helsinki one of the wealthiest capitals in Europe. In 2004, the local economy grew by 3.2%. Helsinki's GDP per capita is one of the highest of any city in the world.

Since the 1950s, the economy has become largely service-based, although industries such as shipbuilding continue to employ a substantial number of people. Large service-based employers include the public sector and the information technology sector. Helsinki has many staffing agencies.

The metropolitan area is the location of choice for the headquarters of large Finnish companies as well as the regional headquarters of international companies. The Helsinki metropolitan area has the best availability of highly skilled employees in Finland, and good infrastructure and business support systems. Since June 2007, the city centre has hosted the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which has led to the relocation of several hundred international experts and their families to Helsinki.

The distribution of affluent to middle and working class neighbourhoods is relatively even in Helsinki. Expensive real estate is located on the main peninsula as well as on the coastline from west to east. Some neighbourhoods in the northwest and eastern parts show slightly higher unemployment levels and have more immigrants. Helsinki is also losing companies to Espoo  . Improving the economy of Helsinki and cooperation between the municipalities of the Helsinki conurbation are seen as major future challenges for the economic development of the region.

Helsinki's population growth has been steady for some time even though intra-areal migration has favoured Espoo and surrounding areas uptil very recently. The population of Greater Helsinki grew by   in 2007 alone.  Helsinki Region Trends 2008, City of Helsinki  The fastest growing area is the countryside belt between Ingå, Kirkkonummi, Vihti and Nurmijärvi and Pornainen, though absolute numbers were in hundreds between 2000–2004.

The Helsinki Metro with its characteristic bright orange trains is the world's northernmost subway.

Public transportation is generally a hotly debated subject in the local politics of Helsinki. In Helsinki, public transportation is mostly managed under Helsinki City Transport, the city's transportation authority. The diverse public transport system consists of trams, light commuter rail, the subway, bus lines and two ferry lines. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council manages traffic to the surrounding municipalities of Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen.

Today, Helsinki is the only city in Finland to have trams or subway trains. There used to be two other cities in Finland with trams: Turku and Viipuri (Vyborg, now in Russia), but both have since abandoned trams. The Helsinki Metro, opened in the year 1982, is so far the only subway system in Finland. In 2006, the construction of the long debated extension of the subway system west into Espoo was approved, and serious debate about an eastern extension into Sipoo has taken place.  www.lansimetro.fi – an information portal dedicated to the "länsimetro" subway expansion in the Helsinki capital region.
